=for section DESCRIPTION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This object describes a parameter which holds the name of a class known to the
GLib type system.  The name of the class is considered to be the common
ancestor for valid values.  To create a param that allows any type name,
specify C<undef> for the package name.  Beware, however, that although
we say "any type name", this actually refers to any type registered
with Glib; normal Perl packages will not work.
