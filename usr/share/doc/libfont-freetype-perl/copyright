The upstream source tarball directory t/data/ contains two font files,
which are used by the test suite to make sure that the Font::FreeType
module works with some real-life fonts. Both of these are Free Software,
and can therefore be legally redistributed with the module.


The font file '5x7.bdf' contains a small bitmap font, and has the following
non-copyright terms:

   "Public domain font.  Share and enjoy."

The file '5x7.fnt' was converted from '5x7.bdf' using 'fontforge'.  It only
contains the glyphs up to character 255.


The font file 'Vera.ttf' contains a sans-serif font in TrueType format from
Bitstream, Inc.  It can be obtained freely from this webpage:

   http://www.gnome.org/fonts/

The font is licensed under the following terms:
