To properly convert some PDF files in CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean)
languages, the poppler-data_ package has to be installed.

.. _poppler-data:
   http://poppler.freedesktop.org/poppler-data-0.3.0.tar.gz

For the Windows port:

- unpack the archive;
- rename the extracted directory to ``poppler-data``;
- put it into the same directory as the ``pdf2djvu.exe`` file.

.. vim:ft=rst ts=3 sw=3 et tw=72
