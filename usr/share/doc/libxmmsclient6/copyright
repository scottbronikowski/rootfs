[ Copyleft Attitude ]

Free Art License 1.3 (FAL 1.3)

Preamble

The Free Art License grants the right to freely copy, distribute, and transform
creative works without infringing the author's rights.

The Free Art License recognizes and protects these rights. Their implementation
has been reformulated in order to allow everyone to use creations of the human
mind in a creative manner, regardless of their types and ways of expression.

While the public's access to creations of the human mind usually is restricted
by the implementation of copyright law, it is favoured by the Free Art License.
This license intends to allow the use of a work’s resources; to establish new
conditions for creating in order to increase creation opportunities. The Free
Art License grants the right to use a work, and acknowledges the right holder’s
and the user’s rights and responsibility.

The invention and development of digital technologies, Internet and Free
Software have changed creation methods: creations of the human mind can
obviously be distributed, exchanged, and transformed. They allow to produce
common works to which everyone can contribute to the benefit of all.

The main rationale for this Free Art License is to promote and protect these
creations of the human mind according to the principles of copyleft: freedom to
use, copy, distribute, transform, and prohibition of exclusive appropriation.

Definitions

“work” either means the initial work, the subsequent works or the common work
as defined hereafter:

“common work” means a work composed of the initial work and all subsequent
contributions to it (originals and copies). The initial author is the one who,
by choosing this license, defines the conditions under which contributions are
made.

“Initial work” means the work created by the initiator of the common work (as
defined above), the copies of which can be modified by whoever wants to

“Subsequent works” means the contributions made by authors who participate in
the evolution of the common work by exercising the rights to reproduce,
distribute, and modify that are granted by the license.

“Originals” (sources or resources of the work) means all copies of either the
initial work or any subsequent work mentioning a date and used by their
author(s) as references for any subsequent updates, interpretations, copies or
reproductions.

“Copy” means any reproduction of an original as defined by this license.

1. OBJECT
The aim of this license is to define the conditions under which one can use
this work freely.

2. SCOPE
This work is subject to copyright law. Through this license its author
specifies the extent to which you can copy, distribute, and modify it.

2.1 FREEDOM TO COPY (OR TO MAKE REPRODUCTIONS)
You have the right to copy this work for yourself, your friends or any other
person, whatever the technique used.

2.2 FREEDOM TO DISTRIBUTE, TO PERFORM IN PUBLIC
You have the right to distribute copies of this work; whether modified or not,
whatever the medium and the place, with or without any charge, provided that
you:
attach this license without any modification to the copies of this work or
indicate precisely where the license can be found,
specify to the recipient the names of the author(s) of the originals, including
yours if you have modified the work,
specify to the recipient where to access the originals (either initial or
subsequent).
The authors of the originals may, if they wish to, give you the right to
distribute the originals under the same conditions as the copies.

2.3 FREEDOM TO MODIFY
You have the right to modify copies of the originals (whether initial or
subsequent) provided you comply with the following conditions:
all conditions in article 2.2 above, if you distribute modified copies;
indicate that the work has been modified and, if it is possible, what kind of
modifications have been made;
distribute the subsequent work under the same license or any compatible license.
The author(s) of the original work may give you the right to modify it under the
same conditions as the copies.

3. RELATED RIGHTS
Activities giving rise to author’s rights and related rights shall not
challenge the rights granted by this license.
For example, this is the reason why performances must be subject to the same
license or a compatible license. Similarly, integrating the work in a database,
a compilation or an anthology shall not prevent anyone from using the work
under the same conditions as those defined in this license.

4. INCORPORATION OF THE WORK
Incorporating this work into a larger work that is not subject to the Free Art
License shall not challenge the rights granted by this license.
If the work can no longer be accessed apart from the larger work in which it is
incorporated, then incorporation shall only be allowed under the condition that
the larger work is subject either to the Free Art License or a compatible
license.

5. COMPATIBILITY
A license is compatible with the Free Art License provided:
it gives the right to copy, distribute, and modify copies of the work including
for commercial purposes and without any other restrictions than those required
by the respect of the other compatibility criteria;
it ensures proper attribution of the work to its authors and access to previous
versions of the work when possible;
it recognizes the Free Art License as compatible (reciprocity);
it requires that changes made to the work be subject to the same license or to
a license which also meets these compatibility criteria.

6. YOUR INTELLECTUAL RIGHTS
This license does not aim at denying your author's rights in your contribution
or any related right. By choosing to contribute to the development of this
common work, you only agree to grant others the same rights with regard to your
contribution as those you were granted by this license. Conferring these rights
does not mean you have to give up your intellectual rights.

7. YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES
The freedom to use the work as defined by the Free Art License (right to copy,
distribute, modify) implies that everyone is responsible for their own actions.

8. DURATION OF THE LICENSE
This license takes effect as of your acceptance of its terms. The act of
copying, distributing, or modifying the work constitutes a tacit agreement.
This license will remain in effect for as long as the copyright which is
attached to the work. If you do not respect the terms of this license, you
automatically lose the rights that it confers.
If the legal status or legislation to which you are subject makes it impossible
for you to respect the terms of this license, you may not make use of the
rights which it confers.

9. VARIOUS VERSIONS OF THE LICENSE
This license may undergo periodic modifications to incorporate improvements by
its authors (instigators of the “Copyleft Attitude” movement) by way of new,
numbered versions.
You will always have the choice of accepting the terms contained in the version
under which the copy of the work was distributed to you, or alternatively, to
use the provisions of one of the subsequent versions.

10. SUB-LICENSING
Sub-licenses are not authorized by this license. Any person wishing to make use
of the rights that it confers will be directly bound to the authors of the
common work.

11. LEGAL FRAMEWORK
This license is written with respect to both French law and the Berne
Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works.

art world. The goal was to adapt the principles of Copyleft and free software
to all sorts of creations. http://www.artlibre.org
