            This chapter is intended to provide a quick introduction to structured
            markup (<acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>). If you're already familiar with <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> or
            <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>, you only need to skim this chapter.

         <p>
            To work with DocBook, you need to understand a few basic concepts of
            structured editing in general, and DocBook, in particular. That's
            covered here. You also need some concrete experience with the way a
            DocBook document is structured. That's covered in the next chapter.

               This chapter doesn't assume that you know what <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> is, but if you
               do, you have a starting point for understanding structured
               markup. <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> (Hypertext Markup Language) is a way of marking up text
               and graphics so that the most popular web browsers can interpret
               them. <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> consists of a set of markup tags with specific
               meanings. Moreover, <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> is a very basic type of <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> markup that
               is easy to learn and easy for computer applications to generate. But
               the simplicity of <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> is both its virtue and its weakness. Because
               of <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym>'s limitations, web users and programmers have had to extend
               and enhance it by a series of customizations and revisions that still
               fall short of accommodating current, to say nothing of future, needs.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               
               
               <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>, on the other hand, is an international standard that describes
               how markup languages are defined. <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> does not consist of
               particular tags or the rules for their usage. <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> is an example of
               a markup language defined in <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>.

               <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> promises an intelligent improvement over <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym>, and
               compatibility with it is already being built into the most popular web
               browsers. <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> is not a new markup language designed to compete with
               <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym>, and it's not designed to create conversion headaches for people
               with tons of <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> documents. <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> is intended to alleviate
               compatibility problems with browser software; it's a new, easier
               version of the standard rules that govern the markup itself, or, in
               other words, a new version of <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>. The rules of <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> are designed
               to make it easier to write both applications that interpret its type
               of markup and applications that generate its markup. <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> was
               developed by a team of <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> experts who understood and sought to
               correct the problems of learning and implementing <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>. <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> is
               also <span class="emphasis"><em>extensible</em></span> markup, which means that it is
               customizable. A browser or word processor that is <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>-capable will
               be able to read any <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>-based markup language that an individual
               user defines.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               In this book, we tend to describe things in terms of <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>, but where
               there are differences between <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> (and there are only a
               few), we point them out. For our purposes, it doesn't really matter
               whether you use <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> or <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               During the coming months, we anticipate that <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>-aware web browsers
               and other tools will become available. Nevertheless, it's not
               unreasonable to do your authoring in <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> and your online publishing
               in <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> or <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym>. By the same token, it's not unreasonable to do
               your authoring in <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>.

                  An essential characteristic of structured markup is that it explicitly
                  distinguishes (and accordingly &#8220;marks up&#8221; within a
                  document) the structure and semantic content of a document. It does
                  not mark up the way in which the document will appear to the reader,
                  in print or otherwise.
                  
               </p>
               <p>
                  In the days before word processors it was common for a typed
                  manuscript to be submitted to a publisher. The manuscript identified
                  the logical structures of the documents (chapters, section titles, and
                  so on), but said nothing about its appearance. Working independently
                  of the author, a designer then developed a specification for the
                  appearance of the document, and a typesetter marked up and applied the
                  designer's format to the document.
                  
               </p>
               <p>
                  <a class="indexterm" name="d0e805"></a>
                  <a class="indexterm" name="d0e811"></a>
                  
                  Because presentation or appearance is usually based on structure and
                  content, <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> markup logically precedes and generally determines the
                  way a document will look to a reader. If you are familiar with strict,
                  simple <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym> markup, you know that a given document that is
                  structurally the same can also look different on different
                  computers. That's because the markup does not specify many aspects of
                  a document's appearance, although it does specify many aspects of a
                  document's structure.
                  
               </p>
               <p>
                  <a class="indexterm" name="d0e825"></a>
                  <a class="indexterm" name="d0e831"></a>
                  Many writers type their text into a word processor, line-by-line and
                  word-for-word, italicizing technical terms, underlining words for
                  emphasis, or setting section headers in a font complementary to the
                  body text, and finally, setting the headers off with a few carriage
                  returns fore and aft. The format such a writer imposes on the words on
                  the screen imparts structure to the document by changing its
                  appearance in ways that a reader can more or less reliably decode.
                  The reliability depends on how consistently and unambiguously the
                  changes in type and layout are made. By contrast, an <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>/<acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>
                  markup of a section header explicitly specifies that a specific piece
                  of text is a section header. This assertion does not specify the
                  presentation or appearance of the section header, but it makes the
                  fact that the text is a section header completely unambiguous.

                  <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> use named elements, delimited by angle brackets
                  (&#8220;&lt;&#8221; and &#8220;&gt;&#8221;) to identify the markup in a
                  document. In DocBook, a top-level section is <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;sect1&gt;</code>, so the title of a top-level section
                  named <span class="emphasis"><em>My First-Level Header</em></span> would be identified
                  like this:
                  
               </p><pre class="screen">&lt;sect1&gt;&lt;title&gt;My First-Level Header&lt;/title&gt; </pre><p>Note the following features of this markup:</p>
               <div class="variablelist">

                        <p>A title begins with <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;
                              title&gt;</code> and ends with <code class="sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/title&gt;</code>. The <a href="sect1.html"><code class="sgmltag-element">sect1</code></a> also has
                           an ending <code class="sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/sect1&gt;</code>, but we haven't
                           shown the whole section so it's not visible.

                           inside a title in a <a href="sect1.html"><code class="sgmltag-element">sect1</code></a>. A

                  In an <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> document, there is no obligatory difference between the
                  size or face of the type in a first-level section header and the title
                  of a book in a footnote or the first sentence of a body paragraph. All
                  <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> files are simple text files without font changes or special
                  characters.<sup>[<a name="d0e983" href="#ftn.d0e983" class="footnote">1</a>]</sup> Similarly, an <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> document
                  does not specify the words in a text that are to be set in italic,
                  bold, or roman type. Instead, <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> marks certain kinds of texts for
                  their semantic content. For example, if a particular word is the name
                  of a file, then the tags around it should specify that it is a
                  filename:
                  
               </p><pre class="screen">Many mail programs read configuration information from the
users <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;filename&gt;</code>.mailrc<code class="sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/filename&gt;</code> file.</pre><p>

                  If the meaning of a phrase is particularly audacious, it might get
                  tagged for boldness of thought instead of appearance. An <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>
                  document contains all the information that a typesetter needs to lay
                  out and typeset a printed page in the most effective and consistent
                  way, but it does not specify the layout or the
                  type.<sup>[<a name="d0e1048" href="#ftn.d0e1048" class="footnote">2</a>]</sup>

                  Not only is the structure of an <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>/<acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> document explicit, but it
                  is also carefully controlled. An <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> document makes reference to a
                  set of declarations&#8212;a document type definition
                  (<acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym>)&#8212;that contains an inventory of tag names and specifies
                  the combination rules for the various structural and semantic features
                  that make up a document. What the distinctive features are and how
                  they should be combined is &#8220;arbitrary&#8221; in the sense that
                  almost any selection of features and rules of composition is
                  theoretically possible. The DocBook <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym> chooses a particular set of
                  features and rules for its users.

                  specifies that a third-level section can follow a second-level section
                  but cannot follow a first-level section without an intervening
                  second-level section.

                  Because an <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>/<acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> document has an associated <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym> that
                  describes the valid, logical structures of the document, you can test
                  the logical structure of any particular document against the
                  <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym>. This process is performed by a <em class="firstterm">parser</em>. An
                  <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> processor must begin by parsing the document and determining if
                  it is valid, that is, if it conforms to the rules specified in the
                  <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym>. <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> processors are not required to
                  check for validity, but it's always a good idea to check for validity
                  when authoring. Because you can test and validate the
                  structure of an <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>/<acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> document with software, a DocBook
                  document containing a first-level section followed immediately by a
                  third-level section will be identified as invalid, meaning that it's
                  not a valid <em class="firstterm">instance</em> or example of a document
                  defined by the DocBook <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym>. Presumably, a document with a logical
                  structure won't normally jump from a first- to a third-level section,
                  so the rule is a safeguard&#8212;but not a guarantee&#8212;of good
                  writing, or at the very least, reasonable structure. A parser also
                  verifies that the names of the tags are correct and that tags
                  requiring an ending tag have them. This means that a valid document is
                  also one that should format correctly, without runs of paragraphs
                  incorrectly appearing in bold type or similar monstrosities that
                  everyone has seen in print at one time or another. For more

                  In general, adherence to the explicit rules of structure and markup in
                  a <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym> is a useful and reassuring guarantee of consistency and
                  reliability within documents, across document sets, and over
                  time. This makes <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>/<acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> markup particularly desirable to
                  corporations or governments that have large sets of documents to
                  manage, but it is a boon to the individual writer as well.

                     Semantic markup makes your documents more amenable to interpretation
                     by software, especially publishing software. You can publish a white

                     You can produce each of these publications from exactly the same
                     source document using the presentational techniques best suited to
                     both the content of the document and the presentation medium. This
                     versatility also frees the author to concentrate on the document
                     content. For example, as we write this book, we don't know exactly how
                     O'Reilly will choose to present chapter headings, bulleted lists,
                     <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> terms, or any of the other semantic features. And we don't
                     care. It's irrelevant; whatever presentation is chosen, the <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>
                     sources will be transformed automatically into that style.

                     Semantic markup can relieve the author of other, more significant
                     burdens as well (after all, careful use of paragraph and character
                     styles in a word processor document theoretically allows us to change
                     the presentation independently from the document). Using semantic
                     markup opens up your documents to a world of possibilities. Documents
                     become, in a loose sense, databases of information. Programs can
                     compile, retrieve, and otherwise manipulate the documents in
                     predictable, useful ways.

                     Consider the online version of this book: almost every element name
                     (<a href="article.html"><code class="sgmltag-element">Article</code></a>, <a href="book.html"><code class="sgmltag-element">Book</code></a>, and so on) is a
                     hyperlink to the reference page that describes that
                     element. Maintaining these links by hand would be tedious and might be
                     unreliable, as well. Instead, every element name is marked as an
                     element using <a href="sgmltag.html"><code class="sgmltag-element">SGMLTag</code></a>: a <a href="book.html"><code class="sgmltag-element">Book</code></a> is
                     a <code class="literal"><code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;sgmltag&gt;</code>Book<code class="sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/sgmltag&gt;</code></code>.

                  <p>
                     Because each element name in this book is tagged semantically, the
                     program that produces the online version can determine which
                     occurrences of the word &#8220;book&#8221; in the text are actually
                     references to the <a href="book.html"><code class="sgmltag-element">Book</code></a> element. The program can
                     then automatically generate the appropriate hyperlink when it should.

                     There's one last point to make about the versatility of <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>
                     documents: how much you have depends on the <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym>. If you take a good
                     photo with a high resolution lens, you can print it and copy it and
                     scan it and put it on the Web, and it will look good. If you start
                     with a low-resolution picture it will not survive those
                     transformations so well. DocBook <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>/<acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> has this advantage over,
                     say, <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym>: DocBook has specific and unambiguous semantic and
                     structural markup, because you can convert its documents with ease
                     into other presentational forms, and search them more precisely. If
                     you start with <acronym class="acronym">HTML</acronym>, whose markup is at a lower resolution than
                     DocBook's, your versatility and searchability is substantially
                     restricted and cannot be improved.

                     There are a few significant shortcomings to structured authoring:

                           <p>It requires a significant change in the authoring
                              process. Writing structured documents is very different from writing
                              with a typical word processor, and change is difficult. In particular,
                              authors don't like giving up control over the appearance of their
                              words especially now that they have acquired it with the advent of
                              word processors. But many publishing companies need authors to
                              relinquish that control, because book design and production remains
                              their job, not their authors'.

                              must create the presentational form from the structural form. Writing
                              stylesheets is a skill in its own right, and though not every author
                              among a group of authors has to learn how to write them, someone has
                              to.

                              pretty expensive. While it's not entirely unreasonable to edit

               <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>/<acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> markup consists primarily of
               <em class="firstterm">elements</em>, <em class="firstterm">attributes</em>,
               and <em class="firstterm">entities</em>. Elements are the terms we have
               been speaking about most, like <a href="sect1.html"><code class="sgmltag-element">sect1</code></a>, that describe
               a document's content and structure. Most elements are represented by pairs
               of tags and
               mark the start and end of the construct they surround&#8212;for
               example, the <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> source for this particular paragraph begins with a
               <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;para&gt;</code> tag and ends with a <code class="sgmltag-endtag">&lt;/para&gt;</code> tag. Some elements are
               &#8220;empty&#8221; (such as DocBook's cross-reference element,
               <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;xref&gt;</code>) and require no end
               tag.<sup>[<a name="d0e1464" href="#ftn.d0e1464" class="footnote">3</a>]</sup>
               
            </p>
            <p>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1478"></a>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1484"></a>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1490"></a>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1496"></a>
               
               Elements can, but don't necessarily, include one or more attributes,
               which are additional terms that extend the function or refine the
               content of a given element. For instance, in DocBook a <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;sect1&gt;</code> start tag can contain an
               identifier&#8212;an <code class="sgmltag-attribute">id</code>
               attribute&#8212;that will ultimately allow the writer to
               cross-reference it or enable a reader to retrieve it. End tags cannot
               contain attributes. A <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;sect1&gt;</code>
               element with an <code class="sgmltag-attribute">id</code> attribute
               looks like this:
               
            </p><pre class="screen">&lt;sect1 id="<em class="replaceable"><code>idvalue</code></em>"&gt;</pre><p>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1521"></a>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1527"></a>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1533"></a>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1539"></a>
               
               In <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>, the catalog of attributes that can occur on an element is
               predefined. You cannot add arbitrary attribute names to an
               element. Similarly, the values allowed for each attribute are
               predefined. In <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>, the use of <a class="ulink" href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/" target="_top">namespaces</a> may allow you
               to add additional attributes to an element, but as of this writing,
               there's no way to perform validation on those attributes.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1556"></a>
               <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1562"></a>
               
               The <code class="sgmltag-attribute">id</code> attribute is one half of a
               cross reference. An <code class="sgmltag-attribute">idref</code>
               attribute on another element, for example <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;xref linkend=&#8221;idvalue&#8221;
                  &gt;</code>, provides the other half. These attributes provide whatever
               application might process the <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> source with the data needed
               either to make a hypertext link or to substitute a named and/or numbered cross
               reference in place of the <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;
                  xref&gt;</code>. Another use for attributes is to specify subclasses of
               certain elements. For instance, you can subdivide DocBook's <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;systemitem&gt;</code> into <acronym class="acronym">URL</acronym>s and
               email addresses by making the content of the <code class="sgmltag-attribute">role</code> attribute the distinction between
               them, as in <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;systemitem role="URL"&gt;</code>
               versus <code class="sgmltag-starttag">&lt;systemitem
                  role="emailaddr"&gt;</code>.

               Entities are a fundamental concept in <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> and <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>, and can be
               somewhat daunting at first. They serve a number of related, but
               slightly different functions, and this makes them a little bit
               complicated.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               In the most general terms, entities allow you to assign a name to some
               chunk of data, and use that name to refer to that data. The complexity
               arises because there are two different contexts in which you can use
               entities (in the <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym> and in your documents), two types of entities
               (parsed and unparsed), and two or three different ways in which the
               entities can point to the chunk of data that they name.
               
            </p>
            <p>
               In the rest of this section, we'll describe each of the commonly
               encountered entity types. If you find the material in this section
               confusing, feel free to skip over it now and come back to it later.
               We'll refer to the different types of entities as the need arises in
               our discussion of DocBook. Come back to this section when you're
               looking for more detail.

               Entities can be divided into two broad categories, <em class="firstterm">general
                  entities</em> and <em class="firstterm">parameter entities</em>.
               Parameter entities are most often used in the <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym>, not in documents,
               so we'll describe them last. Before you can use any type of entity, it
               must be formally declared. This is typically done in the document
               prologue, as we'll explain in <a class="xref" href="ch02.html" title="Creating DocBook Documents">Chapter&nbsp;2, <i>Creating DocBook Documents</i></a>, but we will
               show you how to declare each of the entities discussed here.

                  In use, general entities are introduced with an ampersand (&amp;) and end with
                  a semicolon (;). Within the category of general entities, there are
                  two types: <em class="firstterm">internal general entities</em> and
                  <em class="firstterm">external general entities</em>.

                     With internal entities, you can associate an essentially arbitrary
                     piece of text (which may have other markup, including references to
                     other entities) with a name. You can then include that text by
                     referring to its name. For example, if your document frequently refers
                     to, say, &#8220;O'Reilly &amp; Associates,&#8221; you might declare it
                     as an entity:
                     
                  </p><pre class="screen">&lt;!ENTITY ora "O'Reilly &amp;amp; Associates"&gt;</pre><p>
                     Then, instead of typing it out each time, you can insert it as needed
                     in your document with the entity reference <code class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;ora;</code>, simply to save time. Note that this
                     entity declaration includes another entity reference within it.
                     That's perfectly valid as long as the reference isn't directly or
                     indirectly recursive.

                     <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1702"></a>
                     
                     If you find that you use a number of entities across many documents,
                     you can add them directly to the <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym> and avoid having to include the
                     declarations in each document. See the discussion of

                     With external entities, you can reference other documents from within
                     your document. If these entities contain document text (<acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> or
                     <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>), then references to them cause the parser to insert the text of
                     the external file directly into your document (these are called parsed
                     entities). In this way, you can use entities to divide your single,
                     logical document into physically distinct chunks. For example, you
                     might break your document into four chapters and store them in
                     separate files. At the top of your document, you would include entity
                     declarations to reference the four files:
                     
                  </p><pre class="screen">&lt;!ENTITY ch01 SYSTEM "ch01.sgm"&gt;

                     Your <a href="book.html"><code class="sgmltag-element">Book</code></a> now consists simply of references to the
                     entities:
                     
                  </p><pre class="screen">&lt;book&gt;

                     Sometimes it's useful to reference external files that don't contain
                     document text. For example, you might want to reference an external
                     graphic. You can do this with entities by declaring the type of data
                     that's in the entity using a notation (these are called unparsed
                     entities). For example, the following declaration declares the entity
                     <code class="literal">tree</code> as an encapsulated PostScript image:
                     
                  </p><pre class="screen">&lt;!ENTITY tree SYSTEM "tree.eps" NDATA EPS&gt;</pre><p>
                     <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1775"></a>
                     
                     Entities declared this way cannot be inserted directly into your
                     document. Instead, they must be used as entity attributes to elements:
                     
                  </p><pre class="screen">&lt;graphic entityref="tree"&gt;&lt;/graphic&gt;</pre><p>
                     Conversely, you cannot use entities declared without a notation as the
                     value of an entity attribute.

                     In order for the parser to recognize markup in your document, it must
                     be able to distinguish markup from content. It does this with two
                     special characters: &#8220;&lt;,&#8221; which identifies the beginning
                     of a start or end tag, and &#8220;&amp;,&#8221; which identifies the
                     beginning of an entity reference.<sup>[<a name="d0e1808" href="#ftn.d0e1808" class="footnote">4</a>]</sup>
                     If you want these characters to have their literal value, they must be
                     encoded as entity references in your document. The entity reference
                     <code class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;lt;</code> produces a left angle bracket;
                     <code class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;amp;</code> produces the
                     ampersand.<sup>[<a name="d0e1858" href="#ftn.d0e1858" class="footnote">5</a>]</sup>

                     If you do not encode each of these as their respective entity
                     references, then an <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> parser or application is likely to
                     interpret them as characters introducing elements or entities (an
                     <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> parser will always interpret them this way); consequently, they
                     won't appear as you intended. If you wish to cite text that contains
                     literal ampersands and less-than signs, you need to transform these
                     two characters into entity references before they are included in a
                     DocBook document. The only other alternative is to incorporate text
                     that includes them in your document through some process that avoids
                     the parser.

                     In <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>, character entities are frequently declared using a third
                     entity category (one that we deliberately chose to overlook), called
                     <em class="firstterm">data entities</em>. In <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>, these are declared using
                     numeric character references. Numeric character references resemble
                     entity references, but technically aren't the same. They have the form
                     <code class="literal">&amp;#<em class="replaceable"><code>999</code></em>;</code>, in which
                     &#8220;999&#8221; is the numeric character number.

                     <a class="indexterm" name="d0e1920"></a>
                     
                     In <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>, the numeric character number is always the Unicode character
                     number. In addition, <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> allows hexadecimal numeric character
                     references of the form
                     <code class="literal">&amp;#x<em class="replaceable"><code>hhhh</code></em>;</code>. In <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>, the
                     numeric character number is a number from the document character set
                     that's declared in the <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> declaration.

                     Character entities are also used to give a name to special characters
                     that can't otherwise be typed or are not portable across applications
                     and operating systems. You can then include these characters in your
                     document by refering to their entity name. Instead of using the often
                     obscure and inconsistent key combinations of your particular word
                     processor to type, say, an uppercase letter U with an umlaut (&Uuml;),
                     you type in an entity for it instead. For instance, the entity for an
                     uppercase letter U with an umlaut has been defined as the entity
                     <code class="literal">Uuml</code>, so you would type in <code class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;Uuml;</code> to reference it instead of the actual
                     character. The <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> application that eventually processes your
                     document for presentation will match the entity to your platform's
                     handling of special characters in order to render it
                     appropriately.

                  Parameter entities are only recognized in markup declarations (in the
                  <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym>, for example). Instead of beginning with an ampersand, they
                  begin with a percent sign.  Parameter entities are most frequently

                     You might use a parameter entity reference in an <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> document in a
                     marked section. Marking sections is a mechanism for indicating that
                     special processing should apply to a particular block of text.  Marked
                     sections are introduced by the special sequence
                     <code class="literal">&lt;![<em class="replaceable"><code>keyword</code></em>[</code> and end
                     with <code class="literal">]]&gt;</code>.  In <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>, marked sections can appear
                     in both <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym>s and document instances.  In <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>, they're only allowed

                     The most common keywords are <code class="literal">INCLUDE</code>, which
                     indicates that the text in the marked section should be included in
                     the document; <code class="literal">IGNORE</code>, which indicates that the text
                     in the marked section should be ignored (it completely disappears from
                     the parsed document); and <code class="literal">CDATA</code>, which indicates
                     that all markup characters within that section should be ignored
                     except for the closing characters <code class="literal">]]&gt;</code>.

                     In <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>, these keywords can be parameter entities. For example, you
                     might declare the following parameter entity in your document:
                     
                  </p><pre class="screen">&lt;!ENTITY % draft "INCLUDE"&gt;</pre><p>
                     Then you could put the sections of the document that are only applicable

               and other prose documents, particularly technical
               documentation. DocBook is defined using the native <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym> syntax of

                  HaL Computer Systems and O'Reilly. Its popularity grew, and eventually
                  it spawned its own maintenance organization, the Davenport Group. In
                  mid-1998, it became a Technical Committee (<acronym class="acronym">TC</acronym>) of
                  the Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information
                  Standards (<acronym class="acronym">OASIS</acronym>).

                     The DocBook <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym> was originally designed and implemented by HaL
                     Computer Systems and O'Reilly &amp; Associates around 1991. It was
                     developed primarily to facilitate the exchange of <acronym class="acronym">UNIX</acronym> documentation
                     originally marked up in <span class="command"><strong>troff</strong></span>. Its design appears

                     When DocBook <acronym class="acronym">V1.1</acronym> was published, discussion about
                     its revision and maintenance began in earnest in the Davenport Group,
                     a forum created by O'Reilly for computer documentation
                     producers. Version 1.2 was influenced strongly by
                     Novell and Digital.

                     In 1994, the Davenport Group became an officially chartered entity

                     <acronym class="acronym">V1.2.2</acronym> was published simultaneously. The founding

                     Under the auspices of the Davenport Group, the DocBook <acronym class="acronym">DTD</acronym> began to
                     widen its scope. It was now being used by a much wider audience, and
                     for new purposes, such as direct authoring with <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>-aware tools,
                     and publishing directly to paper. As the largest users of DocBook,
                     Novell and Sun had a heavy influence on its design.

                     In order to help users manage change, the new Davenport charter established
                     the following rules for DocBook releases:
                     
                     <div class="itemizedlist">
                        <ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
                           <li class="listitem">
                              <p>Minor versions (<span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">point releases</span>&#8221;</span> such as
                                 <acronym class="acronym">V2.2</acronym>) could add to the markup model, but could not
                                 change it in a backward-incompatible way. For example, a new kind of
                                 list element could be added, but it would not be acceptable for the
                                 existing itemized-list model to start requiring two list items inside
                                 it instead of only one. Thus, any document conforming to version
                                 <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>.0 would also conform to
                                 <em class="replaceable"><code>n</code></em>.<em class="replaceable"><code>m</code></em>.

                                 changes. However, the changes would have to be announced in the last
                                 major release.

                     <acronym class="acronym">V3.0</acronym> was released in January 1997. After that time,
                     although DocBook's audience continued to grow, many of the Davenport
                     Group stalwarts became involved in the <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> effort, and development
                     slowed dramatically. The idea of creating an official <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>-compliant
                     version of DocBook was discussed, but not implemented. (For more
                     detailed information about DocBook <acronym class="acronym">V3.0</acronym> and plans
                     for subsequent versions, see <a class="xref" href="appc.html" title="DocBook Versions">Appendix&nbsp;C, <i>DocBook Versions</i></a>.)

                     The sponsors wanted to close out Davenport in an orderly way to ensure
                     that DocBook users would be supported. It was suggested that
                     <acronym class="acronym">OASIS</acronym> become DocBook's new home. An
                     <acronym class="acronym">OASIS</acronym> DocBook Technical Committee was formed in
                     July, 1998, with Eduardo Gutentag of Sun Microsystems as chair.

                  <code class="literal">&lt;xref/&gt;</code>, as we'll see in the section <a class="xref" href="ch02.html#ch02-typexml" title="Typing an SGML Document">the section called &#8220;Typing an <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym> Document&#8221;</a>.

                  In <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>, these characters are fixed. In <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>, it is possible to
                  change the markup start characters, but we won't consider that case
                  here. If you change the markup start characters, you know what you're
                  doing. While we're on the subject, in <acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym>, these characters only
                  have their special meaning if they are followed by a name character.
                  It is, in fact, valid in an <span class="emphasis"><em><acronym class="acronym">SGML</acronym></em></span> (but not an <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym>)
                  document to write &#8220;O'Reilly &amp; Associates&#8221; because the
                  ampersand is not followed by a name character. Don't do this, however.

                  The sequence of characters that end a marked section (see <a class="xref" href="ch01.html#s-ms" title="Marked sections">the section called &#8220;Marked sections&#8221;</a>), such as ]]&gt; must also be encoded with at least
                  one entity reference if it is not being used to end a marked section.
                  For this purpose, you can use the entity reference <code class="sgmltag-genentity">&amp;gt;</code> for the final right angle bracket.

                  Actually, CDATA marked sections are allowed in an <acronym class="acronym">XML</acronym> document, but
                  the keyword cannot be a parameter entity, and it must be typed
                  literally. See the examples on this page.
