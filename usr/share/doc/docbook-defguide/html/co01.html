         <p>Our look is the result of reader comments, our own
            experimentation, and feedback from distribution channels.
            Distinctive covers complement our distinctive approach to
            technical topics, breathing personality and life into
            potentially dry subjects.

         <p>The bird on the cover of <em class="citetitle">DocBook: The Definitive
               Guide</em> is a wood duck.  Often considered one of the most
            beautiful ducks in North America, the male wood duck has a metallic
            purple and green head with white streaks extending from its bill
            around the eyes and down to its blue and green, gold-flecked
            wings. It has a white neck, chestnut-colored chest, a white or red
            bill, and yellow-orange legs and feet. Females have more brown, gray,
            and subdued hues.

         <p>Edie Freedman designed the cover of this book, using a
            19th-century engraving from the Dover Pictorial Archive. The
            cover layout was produced by Kathleen Wilson using QuarkXPress
            3.32 and Adobe's ITC Garamond font. The inside layout was
            designed by Alicia Cech, based on a series design by Nancy
            Priest. The text was formatted from SGML into FrameMaker 5.5
            with Jade, using a DSSSL conversion stylesheet written by
            Chris Maden. The interior fonts are ITC Garamond Light,
            Garamond Book, and ConstantWillison.

            flexible lay-flat binding. If the page count exceeds RepKover's
            limit, perfect binding is used.
