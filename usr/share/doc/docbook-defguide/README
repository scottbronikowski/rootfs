See VERSION.xml for version information.

Alpha Release Notes
===================

0. This is an alpha release. Please do not publish this version.
   I reorganized the sources quite a bit prior to checking them in
   to SourceForge. Some things, for example graphic references, may
   not be perfect yet.

1. All of the files that end in .gen are automatically generated.
   Do not edit these files by hand under any circumstances.

2. Begin parsing at book.xml. You may have to hack the doctype
   declaration a bit to get it to work on your system.
