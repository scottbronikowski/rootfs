                             JAVA_HOME

1. Legacy use of JAVA_HOME

   As of the latest versions of java-common there really should
   be no need for JAVA_HOME as Java(TM) should be completely
   integrated with your Debian GNU/Linux system.

   For reference, the setting of JAVA_HOME for Sun Java 6 is:
     JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-sun

2. Selecting OpenJDK 6 as the default Java(TM) implementation

   Please see README.alternatives for instructions on how
   to make OpenJDK 6 executables and man pages the default on your system.
