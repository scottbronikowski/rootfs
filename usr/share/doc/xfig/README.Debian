xfig for DEBIAN
===============

For additional information about xfig have a look at the xfig web page at
 http://www.xfig.org

Japanese Support
================

Simply set the environment variable LANG to ja_JP.ujis and xfig should 
be hopefully adapted to your needs. I cannot test this out here,
because I don't understand any Japanese nor am I able to understand
the fonts, so if the Japanese adaptions don't work as they should,
please let me know.


Korean Support
==============

Should work in the same way like Japanese support does but with LANG
set to ko_KR.eucKR.


Xaw vs. Xaw3D
=============

xfig can be compiled with Xaw (2D look) as well as with Xaw3D (3D
look).  Xaw3D is designed as a plug-in-replacement for Xaw, so every
program compiled with Xaw should be able to run with Xaw3D.  That's
the theory, while in reality the compatibility isn't perfect.  That
means, that xfig (since version 3.2.3) compiled with Xaw does not run
with Xaw3D ("xfig: Symbol `smeBSBClassRec' has different size in
shared object, consider re-linking").  So I had to decide between
generally using 2D look (also for users who have Xaw3D installed) by
using xaw-wrappers and denying Xaw3D or alternatively to generally use
Xaw3D (and depend on xaw3dg) as recommended by the upstream author.  I
choose the latter option, so xfig is now linked against xaw3dg.


pstex
=====

It's not a xfig but a transfig issue, but there are many people
heaving problems with the pstex driver.  The problem is, that newer
versions of transfig need \usepackage{color} to work with pstex.  So
simply add \usepackage{graphicx} and \usepackage{color} to your LaTeX
file before using pstex and everything should work correct.


Cursor theme
============

You may notice some problems with ugly cursors which don't allow you
to do precise drawings.  This usually depends on the configured cursor
theme.  If you don't like the configure cursor font, have a look at
the output of 
 update-alternatives --display x-cursor-theme
This lists all installed cursor theme with their priorities and shows
which of these alternatives is currently linked.  There were problems
with the gtk2-engines-industrial theme reported, which replaces the
cross hair cursor by a big white cross.  To change the cursor theme
run
 update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme
and select the core.theme.  After this you may have to restart you X
server.
