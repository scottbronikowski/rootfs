libtemplate-perl for Debian
---------------------------

Template Toolkit come with a large amount of documentation and examples
written as TT2 libraries and source files and built into HTML. In the
interest of conserving space for those that don't want this
documentation, it has been moved into a separate package and is
available in libtemplate-perl-doc.
