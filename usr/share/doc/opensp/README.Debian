opensp for Debian
------------------

This document covers the Debian version of the OpenSP suite.

Note that the default search paths compiled into this system are
equivalent to setting the following environment variables as shown:

 SGML_CATALOG_FILES="/etc/sgml/catalog"
 SGML_SEARCH_PATH="/usr/local/share/sgml:/usr/share/sgml"

You can override this by setting these variables yourself, i.e., in
~/.profile or /etc/environment.

For information on using these packages, see the included HTML
documentation.  It also includes links to other sites, for more
information about SGML or DSSSL.  Also see:
