tipa for DEBIAN
---------------

TIPA is a system for processing IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)
symbols in LaTeX written by Fukui Rei.  TIPA stands for wither TeX IPA
or Tokyo IPA. Its primary distribution site is
ftp://tooyoo.L.u-tokyo.ac.jp/pub/TeX/tipa. This Debian package was put
together by Rafael Laboissiere.

TIPA is fully documented in file /usr/share/doc/tipa-doc/tipaman.dvi.gz,
which is a comprehensive manual of TIPA with a detailed list of all
the TIPA phonetic symbols.  The documentation for the optional package
vowel.sty (for drawing vowel diagrams) is found in file
/usr/share/doc/tipa-doc/vowel.dvi.gz.  Both of these files are included in
the tipa-doc package.

This package installs type1 fonts for use with dvips and pdflatex.
These fonts are now automatically available for dvips, pdflatex etc.
