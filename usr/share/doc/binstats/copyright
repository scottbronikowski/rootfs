Upstream sources of binstats were obtained from
<http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/~etzpc/binstats.html>.  It was modified to
use readlink(1) from the debianutils package rather than its own
derefsymlink utility.

The original author is Peter Chang <Peter.Chang@nottingham.ac.uk>.

binstats was packaged for Debian by Johnie Ingram <johnie@debian.org>,
and subsequently maintained by Matej Vela <vela@debian.org>. 
Now the new maintainer of the package is Angel Ramos <seamus@debian.org>.

  PS binstats is released under the GPL and as such the usual licence
