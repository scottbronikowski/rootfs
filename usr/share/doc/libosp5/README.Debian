libosp2 and libosp-dev: SP development support for Debian
--------------------------------------------------------

Include files, from libosp-dev, are available in /usr/include/OpenSP .
You might have to add this to the compiler switches.

Documentation on this library is available in the 'opensp' package,
in the Section "Programming with SP".

Note that the default search paths compiled into this system are
equivalent to setting the following environment variables as shown:

 SGML_CATALOG_FILES="/etc/sgml/catalog"
 SGML_SEARCH_PATH="/usr/local/share/sgml:/usr/share/sgml"

You can override this by setting these variables yourself, i.e., in
~/.profile or /etc/environment.

One other note: unless you include "OpenSP/config.h" first of all, you
will get errors.
