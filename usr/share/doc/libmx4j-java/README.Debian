About MX4j for Debian
========================

Difference to binary upstream release:

[Remote] 
No support of RMI over IIOP protocol due to missing
iiop generation in free rmic compilers.

No SSLAdaptorServerSocketFactory available due to 
hardcoded dependencies to SUN VM's (won't even run
with the IBM Java Runtimes).
