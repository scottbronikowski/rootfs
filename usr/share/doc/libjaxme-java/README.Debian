JaxMe for Debian
----------------

This debian package of JaxMe 2 from the Apache Web Services project is
built without the persistent part for the XML database system Tamino
as this requires non-free libraries.

The persistence part for xmldb is also missing due to a currently
not available xmldb-api library to build against. This might be
added in the future.
