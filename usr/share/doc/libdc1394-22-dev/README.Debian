No support for the juju Firewire stack
--------------------------------------

Please note that the new "juju" Firewire stack in recent Linux 2.6 kernels is
not supported by the libdc1394-22 packages. The juju stack is not complete yet
and IIDC cameras cannot yet be read out correctly.

If your kernel does not provide the modules for the old (but working) Firewire
stack (ohci1394, raw1394, video1394), then you have to compile a kernel
yourself that enables the old stack.

If you have a kernel that provides modules for both the old and the new stack,
it may be that the modules for the new stack are loaded in favour of those for
the old stack. In that case, you have to rmmod firewire-ohci, firewire-sbp2 and
firewire-core, and modprobe ohci1394, raw1394 and video1394.
