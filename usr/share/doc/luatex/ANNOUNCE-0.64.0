Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.64.0.
This is a development release, but it also fixes a few rather
annoying bugs in 0.63.0.


News:

* New lua functions pdf.refobj(), pdf.maxobjnum() and pdf.objtype()

* New lua function node.is_node()

* The max_strings configuration variable's maximum value is
   raised to be identical to texlive's maximum (2097151), and
   same for param_size (32767).

* The embedded mplib is now 1.503.

* Minor cleanups in the output of fontloader.to_table():

   - removed out-of-range altuni's from the output
   - don't dump the extra encodings, just the actual font encoding
   - export the encoding's name also as 'enc_name' at one level up
   - no longer exporting unset macstyles, nor zero uniqueids
   - fix creationtime and modification time

* Ongoing work on the epdf library

Bugfixes:

* Fix a bug where an explicit hyphen prevented hyphenation for the
   whole rest of the paragraph

* Internal font copying forgot to copy the last font dimen

* os.selfdir() is now documented

* patch quad (\fontdimen6) in \letterspacefont to be compatible
   with pdftex

* Multi-page pdf inclusion was very slow in 0.63.0

* Some extra checks added to the handling of glue_spec node
   objects in lua code.

* Some node.prev pointers have been corrected (but this is not
   quite finished).

* A small fix to lpeg 0.9.
