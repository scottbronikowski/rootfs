Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.65.0.

This release mostly fixes a number of bugs, but it also deprecates
a number of existing lua and macro commands. Please read the News
section carefully if you are the current maintainer of a luatex
macro package.

News:

* The Aleph and Omega version primitives are deprecated.

* The Apple Snow Leopard Truetype font collections now work
   properly.

* Libpng has been updated to 1.4.4, and zlib to 1.2.5.

* New lua functions node.next() and node.prev().

* The already deprecated for some time node.protrusion_skipable()
   function has been removed.

* fontloader.apply_featurefile() and fontloader.apply_afmfile()
   now return nil,<errortable> on failure.

* The various node list fields in the lua node interface have
   been renamed from 'list' to 'head', e.g. tex.box[0].head,
   and the 'list' name is deprecated. For now, the deprecation
   is silent, as 'list' will stay for quite some time. Please
   update your lua source as soon as possible, though.

* The call node.type(<node>) now returns "node". The existing
   functionality is otherwise unchanged.

* Luafilesystem has been updated to 1.5.0. NOTE: there is an
   incompatible change in the directory iterator method.

* The restriction on linebreak_filter has been eased: at least one
   horizontal box should be returned, but that is not necessarily
   the last node any more.

* Backward compatibility has been restored for \meaning\mathchar

* node.first_character() has been renamed to node.first_glyph()
   to better match its actual functionality.

* The \Umathaccent primitive now supports both/bottom keywords,
   and \Umathbotaccent / \Umathaccents are now deprecated.

* The \Umathaccent primitive now also supports the fixed keyword,
   which supports non-growing math accents even if the font says
   there are extensible variants.

* Ongoing work on the epdf library.

Bugfixes:

* Assignment to \dimen65535 was broken earlier.

* <box>.head.prev is now always initialized to null (0).

* luatex -lua=<script> '\relax' no longer exits immediately,
   instead going into interactive mode as it should.

* The \jobname was initialized wrongly for input file names
   with multiple dots in them.

* The synctex file is now written in the right place when
   --output-directory is given.

* \letterspacefont could cause crashes, especially when combined
   with font expansion.

* Luatex would crash on linux32 systems if it was build in an
   environment where LFS (>2GB files) was enabled by default.

* Node lists created by node.copy_list() could not be hyphenated
   due to an assertion error.

* Synctex support was partially broken since 0.60.0.

* With OpenType math fonts, accents with multiple parts
   (like the \vec arrow) forgot to include all parts if the
   accentee was too narrow.

* With OpenType math fonts, accents over any class except 0 and 7
   were misplaced.

* kpse.lookup("plain", {all = true}) was broken in kpathsea
   itself (no extension given as well as --all specified).

* A FontForge bug made Cambria Math accents look bad, and the
   placement of math top accents did not allow a marker at the
   origin (patches by Stefan Philipp)

* Cut&Paste from PDF was sometimes broken due to bad ToUnicode map.

* Many small manual improvements (thanks to Paul Isambert)

* An other bugfix to lpeg 0.9 (from Roberto Ierusalimsky)

* Some small fixes to writet1.w (from Han The Thanh)

* A build failure because of bad libz configuration on Win32
