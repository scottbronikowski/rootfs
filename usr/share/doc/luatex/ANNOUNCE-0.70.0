Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.70.0.

This release will be the one on TeXLive 2011 (barring show-stopping
bugs). Compared to 0.66, there is not a lot of news, just a few
bug-fixes.

News:


* fixed: various changes needed for libpng 1.5.2.

* fixed: node.fields() for nodes without subtype.

* fixed: non-argument use of os.execute().

* fixed: tex.[s|t|]print() with invalid catcode table arguments.

* fixed: recorder filename location with --output-directory.

* fixed: display alignment in TRT mode.

* luatex now uses the standard synctex files from Jérome Laurens.


The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

         http://foundry.supelec.fr/gf/project/luatex/

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

   svn co http://foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.70.0

Bugs and feature requests can be added to the issue tracker at

        http://tracker.luatex.org

Have fun,
Taco
