Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.70.1.

About a dozen or so bugfixes that were mostly discovered while
working on TeXLive 2011.

News:

* fixed: recorder file location from TL.

* fixed: missing newline on 'No output' line.

* fixed: relative names in synctex file.

* fixed: 16bit png images in generated %!PDF-1.4.

* fixed: building with (installed) libpng < 1.5.0

* fixed: year in --version output.

* fixed: box output to synctex.

* fixed: FontDescriptor for non-embedded OpenType fonts has an
  invalid FontFile3 entry (#654)

* fixed: crash on non-existent images.

* fixed: small memory leak in the ipc code.

* fixed: tex.print() and tex.sprint() don't recognize -2 as the
  first argument (#659)
