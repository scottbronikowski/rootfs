Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.66.0.

This release has ongoing work on the 'epdf' lua interface by
Hartmut (and that interface now has documentation as well). Besides
that, the release fixes a number of the bugs that have been reported
over the past months (mostly the smaller/easier ones).

Luatex 0.66.0 will be the last release in the 0.6X series. The next
release will be luatex 0.70.0;that will be the version on texlive 2011.

Expect no major differences there either, the tracker has just
a few items remaining for 0.70.0. Over the last half year, I personally
have been much too busy with MetaPost to do any real work on luatex,
hence the somewhat disappointing amount of feature progress.

I have uploaded the 0.66.0 base package to tlcontrib as well, but
please give the builders a few days to create actual platform-
specific binaries.
