Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.63.0.
This is a development release.

News:

* Drop tex.ht[], tex.wd[], tex.dp[].

* Drop OCP support (and associated primitives).

* Add tex.catcode[], tex.lccode[], tex.sfcode[], tex.uccode[],
   tex.mathcode[] and tex.delcode[] and associated functions.

* Add CIDset tables to the output pdf where appropriate.

* Added a 'string' field to late_lua nodes on the lua side. This
   field does not convert the assigned string to a tokenlist.

* The result of fontloader.open() now has some virtual accessors
   (as well as fontloader.to_table).

* There is now a `short reference' in the manual folder
   (functionref.pdf)

Bugfixes:

* Fix a crash on an empty font (bugreport #468).

* Fix a crash for extremely long pattern arguments.

* Fix a crash on bad virtual character arguments in lua.

* Fix hyphenation exceptions.

* Prevent linebreak between initial local_par paragraph whatsit
   and a following skip (bugreport #437).

* Fix placement of scripts on textstyle big operators in MATH
   fonts (bugreport #466).

* Fix a crash on the return value of MPlib's 'postscript'
   operation on images.

* Fix a crash on \leftghost & \rightghost in math mode.
