Hi,

I have just uploaded the archives for a new luatex release, 0.61.0,
the first of the betas toward 0.70.0.

New features:

* New lua library 'epdf' for introspection of PDF inclusions,
   see the manual for details.

* Mplib version 1.502 is now included (which is still beta,
   so be careful).

* new "finish_pdffile" and "pre_dump" callbacks.

* new function pdf.pageref()

* In the lua 'tex' library: assignment to internal glue
   parameters is now allowed.

* New lua function tex.error().

Bugfixes:

* Fix for crashes on fonts with bad Panose values.

* Fix for a box placement bug that could sometimes cause text
   to overlap.

* Fix for a few small PDF/A1-a compatibility bugs.

* Fix \letterspacefont.

* Fix \Ustopdisplaymath in combination with aligned displays.

* In math delimiters, the last of a chain of predefined sizes
   was always ignored if there were also extensible parts.


The archives can be downloaded from supelec as usual:

You could also check out the sources via anonymous svn:

   svn co http://foundry.supelec.fr/svn/luatex/tags/beta-0.61.0

Have fun,
Taco
