Audio File Library 0.3.3
Development Notes
Michael Pruett <michael@68k.org>

----

Large file support is now enabled by default on all systems.  This change
has no effect on systems where off_t is always 64 bits (e.g. IRIX,
FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, Mac OS X).

The Audio File Library supports CCITT G.711 mu-law and A-law as well
as IMA and MS ADPCM.  Many compressed data formats are not supported.
This is currently the most important issue to address.

Error handling is at the present quite robust, but more work can always
be done in this area.

SGI's Audio File Library on IRIX implements the following formats which
this version of the library does not:

	MPEG1 audio bitstream
	Sound Designer II
	SampleVision
	SoundFont2

I plan to implement some of these as time permits.  Sound Designer
II is out of the question because of its dependency upon Macintosh
resource forks.  Handling these files on Unix systems is simply not
worth the effort.

This version of the Audio File Library has been tested under the
following operating environments:

	i686-pc-linux-gnu / Ubuntu 10.10 (gcc 4.4.5)
	x86_64-pc-linux-gnu / Ubuntu 11.10 (gcc 4.6.1)
	i386-pc-freebsd8.2 / FreeBSD 8.2 (gcc 4.2.1)
	i386-apple-darwin10.8.0 / Mac OS X 10.6.8 (gcc 4.2.1)
	x86_64-apple-darwin10.8.0 / Mac OS X 10.6.8 (gcc 4.2.1)
