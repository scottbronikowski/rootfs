ecj
===

This package is not intended for end users!  This is basically to make
it so that you can sanely bootstrap a port.  This high-quality java
compiler is buildable with just gcj-4, which in turn is built in C.

In particular, this doesn't include support for ant - When compiling
with this version of ecj, ant will spawn a new VM instance and shell
out to it to compile.  This means significantly higher memory costs,
and slower compiles.
