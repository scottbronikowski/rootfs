<h3 class="section">33.8 Root Bracketing Algorithms</h3>

<p>The root bracketing algorithms described in this section require an
initial interval which is guaranteed to contain a root&mdash;if a
and b are the endpoints of the interval then f(a) must
differ in sign from f(b).  This ensures that the function crosses
zero at least once in the interval.  If a valid initial interval is used
then these algorithm cannot fail, provided the function is well-behaved.

   <p>Note that a bracketing algorithm cannot find roots of even degree, since
these do not cross the x-axis.

The <dfn>bisection algorithm</dfn> is the simplest method of bracketing the
roots of a function.   It is the slowest algorithm provided by
the library, with linear convergence.

        <p>On each iteration, the interval is bisected and the value of the
function at the midpoint is calculated.  The sign of this value is used
to determine which half of the interval does not contain a root.  That
half is discarded to give a new, smaller interval containing the
root.  This procedure can be continued indefinitely until the interval is
sufficiently small.

        <p>At any time the current estimate of the root is taken as the midpoint of
the interval.

The <dfn>false position algorithm</dfn> is a method of finding roots based on
linear interpolation.  Its convergence is linear, but it is usually
faster than bisection.

        <p>On each iteration a line is drawn between the endpoints (a,f(a))
and (b,f(b)) and the point where this line crosses the
x-axis taken as a &ldquo;midpoint&rdquo;.  The value of the function at
this point is calculated and its sign is used to determine which side of
the interval does not contain a root.  That side is discarded to give a
new, smaller interval containing the root.  This procedure can be
continued indefinitely until the interval is sufficiently small.

        <p>The best estimate of the root is taken from the linear interpolation of
the interval on the current iteration.

The <dfn>Brent-Dekker method</dfn> (referred to here as <dfn>Brent's method</dfn>)
combines an interpolation strategy with the bisection algorithm.  This
produces a fast algorithm which is still robust.

        <p>On each iteration Brent's method approximates the function using an
interpolating curve.  On the first iteration this is a linear
interpolation of the two endpoints.  For subsequent iterations the
algorithm uses an inverse quadratic fit to the last three points, for
higher accuracy.  The intercept of the interpolating curve with the
x-axis is taken as a guess for the root.  If it lies within the
bounds of the current interval then the interpolating point is accepted,
and used to generate a smaller interval.  If the interpolating point is
not accepted then the algorithm falls back to an ordinary bisection
step.

        <p>The best estimate of the root is taken from the most recent
interpolation or bisection.
