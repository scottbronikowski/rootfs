<h3 class="section">1.2 GSL is Free Software</h3>

<p><a name="index-free-software_002c-explanation-of-3"></a>The subroutines in the GNU Scientific Library are &ldquo;free software&rdquo;;
this means that everyone is free to use them, and to redistribute them
in other free programs.  The library is not in the public domain; it is
copyrighted and there are conditions on its distribution.  These
conditions are designed to permit everything that a good cooperating
citizen would want to do.  What is not allowed is to try to prevent
others from further sharing any version of the software that they might
get from you.

   <p>Specifically, we want to make sure that you have the right to share
copies of programs that you are given which use the GNU Scientific
Library, that you receive their source code or else can get it if you
want it, that you can change these programs or use pieces of them in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

   <p>To make sure that everyone has such rights, we have to forbid you to
deprive anyone else of these rights.  For example, if you distribute
copies of any code which uses the GNU Scientific Library, you must give
the recipients all the rights that you have received.  You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code, both to the
library and the code which uses it.  And you must tell them their
rights.  This means that the library should not be redistributed in
proprietary programs.

   <p>Also, for our own protection, we must make certain that everyone finds
out that there is no warranty for the GNU Scientific Library.  If these
programs are modified by someone else and passed on, we want their
recipients to know that what they have is not what we distributed, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on our
reputation.

   <p>The precise conditions for the distribution of software related to the
GNU Scientific Library are found in the GNU General Public License
(see <a href="GNU-General-Public-License.html">GNU General Public License</a>).  Further information about this
license is available from the GNU Project webpage <cite>Frequently Asked
Questions about the GNU GPL</cite>,
