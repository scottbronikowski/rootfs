CatDVI v. 0.14                                    -*- Text -*-
==============

This is a DVI to plain text converter.  The current version is a work
in progress; it may not be robust enough for production work, although
it does work fine for simple linear-text DVI files, and now even for
some more complex DVI files.

Please refer to the man page (man -l ./catdvi.1) or its plain text version,
catdvi.txt, for a discussion of what currently works and what doesn't.

Compiling and Installing CatDVI
-------------------------------

You need a hosted ISO C (1990) environment (almost every moderately modern
C compiler + toolchain should do) and the kpathsea library (included
with e.g. teTeX).

Detailed instructions can be found in INSTALL.

I want CatDVI to be as portable as possible, but can test it only under
GNU/Linux on x86. If you had to make changes to make it work on your
platform, please let me know. Code implementing font search without the
kpathsea library is also welcome.


Release Notes
-------------

New since v. 0.13:
  - More powerful layout algorithm with enhanced vertical positioning
    capabilities and better handling of sub- and superscripts in
    mathematical formulae.
  - New font encodings: all AMS fonts except the cyrillic ones.
  - Completed Blackboard font encoding.
  - Brought in line with Unicode 3.2.
  - Fixed false out of memory errors on some systems (e.g. AIX 4.2).
  - Several small fixes and improvements.

A brief summary of differences from older version can be found in NEWS,
and the full revision history is kept in ChangeLog.
