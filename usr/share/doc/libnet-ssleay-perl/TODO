* Fix POD to pass t/02_pod_coverage.t.

* Update documentation with regard to the various limitations which have been
  removed recently.

* Tests for ssl_read_until.

* Fix this issue on hpux:
	two major diffs to the rest of the world:
	1. libssl.sl instead of libssl.so
	   The default installation still expects .so files, so the sysadm needs to
	   make symlinks to find those Tux

	2. HP-UX uses SHLIB_PATH alongside LD_LIBRARY_PATH Tux HP-UX allows both,
	   and allows them together. The search sequence can be set in each library
	   itself

	If you find your libs in Makefile.PL, you should extend LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	with that location, also in MAKEFILE to make 'make test' pass

* Better test coverage
  + Write a test for http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=9611
  + Test if exports work correctly

* Changelogging!

* Improve the search for installed openssl and zlib libs so it will recognize
  them only runtime is installed without the headers required for building the
  module.

* Instruction on how to the the prerequisites
  Installing OpenSSL
  ------------------
  On Debian and Debian based Operating systems one can install
  by typing:

  apt-get install libssl-dev

  On some Ubuntu versions libssl-dev seems to be broken as it doesn't depend on
  zlib1g-dev.

  apt-get install zlib1g fixes that.
