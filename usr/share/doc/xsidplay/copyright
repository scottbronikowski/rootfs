This package was debianised, prepackaged and is currently maintained
by me, Ulf Jaenicke-Roessler <ujr@debian.org>, from the sources that
I obtained from the SidPlay HomePage at
 http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/5147/
Packaging was taken over by Ivo Timmermans <ivo@debian.org> on Wed, 29 Aug
2001 22:11:30 +0200; and later it was changed to Laszlo Boszormenyi
<gcs@lsc.hu> on Sun, 15 Aug 2004 14:13:08 +0000.

For information about necessary (small) changes, including remarks about
adding support for the Debian package maintenance scheme (ie. about creating
various debian/* files and additional considerations) see Readme.Debian.
This software was developed with, and uses, QT. QT had been finally GPL'ed,
so there is no need anymore for a licence exception.
