IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

This version of sgml-base starts the transition of /usr/lib/sgml to
/usr/share/sgml.  The documentation is not yet integrated into one
single nice document with good examples and guidelines.  This will
definitely change in the near future.  Also the support in the form
of tools is still in its infancy.  This version mainly only moves
the catalogs into place and introduces a tool called update-catalog.
