SGML Entity Management
<br>Chapter 2 - Proposed mapping of public identifiers to system identifiers
</h1>

<hr>

<p>
SGML can refer to an external file (really an entity) with an <var>external
identifier</var>: this is a <var>public identifier</var> or a <var>system
identifier</var>, or both.
</p>

<p>
A typical public identifier looks like
</p>

<pre>
     	  PUBLIC &quot;ISO 8879-1986//ENTITIES Added Latin 1//EN&quot;
</pre>

<p>
where <samp>ISO 8879-1986</samp> is the owner, <samp>ENTITIES</samp> is the
text class and <samp>Added Latin 1</samp> is the text description, and
<samp>EN</samp> is language.
</p>

<p>
A system identifier looks like
</p>

<pre>
     	  SYSTEM &quot;htmlplus.dtd&quot;
</pre>

<p>
where <samp>htmlplus.dtd</samp> is a system-specific identifier.
</p>

<p>
To map external identifiers to file names, one should first try the system
identifier, as a file name, and then search entity catalog files and then
search the list of file names derived from the public identifier.  The catalog
format is according to SGML/Opens resolution on entity management.  The catalog
consists of a series of entries and comments.  A comment is delimited by
<samp>--</samp> like in a markup declaration.
</p>

<p>
The fallback derivation of the file name is modelled after the
<code>sgmls</code> environment variable <var>SGML_PATH</var>, and Emacs
<code>psgml</code> mode's <var>sgml-public-map</var> variable.  There does not
seem to be any official standards (this is left to the implementation), so this
standard is simply an abstraction of real-world practice of SGML tools, and
shall now be the standard for Debian systems, since this is the convention
currently followed by all applications currently in Debian.
</p>

<p>
Contiguous white space is compacted to a single space and replaced with an
underscore (<samp>_</samp>); the characters <samp>/</samp> to <samp>%</samp>
are also replaced with <samp>_</samp>.  The text class is down-cased.  The
language specifier (i.e., <samp>//EN</samp>) and anything following it should
be removed.
