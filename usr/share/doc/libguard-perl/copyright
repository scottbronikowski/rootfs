  To the best of my knowledge, and unless otherwise stated, all the files
  are Copyright Marc Alexander Lehmann <debian-copyright@schmorp.de>,
  2001-2009 for Coro, 2008-2009 for Guard.

  (see also conftest.c, which is lgpl 2.1 or later)

  The actual files have been under a slightly different license for a while
  - I updated the LICENSE file to be consistent, thanks for reminding me :)
