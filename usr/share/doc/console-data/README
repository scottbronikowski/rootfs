This is the SVN experimental branch for console-data development.

Please note that console-data will be re-merged with kbd in the next
Debian release; unless serious proposals and development occur,
console-data will be removed from Debian Etch; development in this
trunk will be limited to changes that can easily be ported to kbd.

This release removes all conflicts with 'kbd' from console-data and
makes console-data an optional package, which recommends 'kbd'.
It still generates all the udebs for debian-installer, though; this will
probably migrate to 'kbd'. With this release, you can now install 
'kbd' and 'console-data', leaving out the obsolete 'console-tools'.
