<h3 class="section">1.11 Enhanced text mode</h3>

<!-- ?enhanced text -->
<p><a name="index-enhanced-23"></a>
Many terminal types support an enhanced text mode in which additional
formatting information is embedded in the text string.  For example, "x^2"
will write x-squared as we are used to seeing it, with a superscript 2. 
This mode is normally selected when you set the terminal, e.g. 
"set term png enhanced", but may also be toggled afterward using
"set termoption enhanced", or by marking individual strings as in
"set label 'x_2' noenhanced".

<pre class="example">      Control      Examples        Explanation
       ^           a^x             superscript
       _           a_x             subscript
       @           @x or a@^b_{cd} phantom box (occupies no width)
       &amp;           &amp;{space}        inserts space of specified length
       ~           ~a{.8-}         overprints '-' on 'a', raised by .8
                                   times the current fontsize
     
</pre>
   <p>Braces can be used to place multiple-character text where a single character
is expected (e.g., 2^{10}).  To change the font and/or size, use the full form:
{/[fontname][=fontsize | *fontscale] text}.  Thus {/Symbol=20 G} is a 20 pt
GAMMA and {/*0.75 K} is a K at three-quarters of whatever fontsize is currently
in effect.  (The '/' character MUST be the first character after the '{'.)

   <p>The phantom box is useful for a@^b_c to align superscripts and subscripts
but does not work well for overwriting an accent on a letter.  For the latter,
it is much better to use an encoding  (e.g. iso_8859_1 or utf8) that contains
a large variety of letters with accents or other diacritical marks.  See
<a href="encoding.html#encoding">encoding</a>. Since the box is non-spacing, it is sensible to put the shorter
of the subscript or superscript in the box (that is, after the @).

   <p>Space equal in length to a string can be inserted using the '&amp;' character. 
Thus
<pre class="example">             'abc&amp;{def}ghi'
</pre>
   <p>would produce
<pre class="example">             'abc   ghi'.
     
</pre>
   <p>The '~' character causes the next character or bracketed text to be
overprinted by the following character or bracketed text.  The second text
will be horizontally centered on the first.  Thus '~a/' will result in an 'a'
with a slash through it.  You can also shift the second text vertically by
preceding the second text with a number, which will define the fraction of the
current fontsize by which the text will be raised or lowered.  In this case
the number and text must be enclosed in brackets because more than one
character is necessary.  If the overprinted text begins with a number, put a
space between the vertical offset and the text ('~{abc}{.5 000}'); otherwise
no space is needed ('~{abc}{.5&mdash;}').  You can change the font for one or
both strings ('~a{.5 /*.2 o}'&mdash;an 'a' with a one-fifth-size 'o' on top&mdash;and
the space between the number and the slash is necessary), but you can't
change it after the beginning of the string.  Neither can you use any other
special syntax within either string.  You can, of course, use control
characters by escaping them (see below), such as '~a{\^}'

   <p>You can access special symbols numerically by specifying \character-code (in
octal), e.g., {/Symbol \245} is the symbol for infinity. This does not work
for multibyte encodings like UTF-8, however.  In a UTF-8 environment, you
should be able to enter multibyte sequences implicitly by typing or otherwise
selecting the character you want.

   <p>You can escape control characters using \, e.g.,  \\, \{, and so on.

   <p>But be aware that strings in double-quotes are parsed differently than those
enclosed in single-quotes.  The major difference is that backslashes may need
to be doubled when in double-quoted strings.

   <p>Examples (these are hard to describe in words&mdash;try them!):
<pre class="example">           set xlabel 'Time (10^6 {/Symbol m}s)'
           set title '{/Symbol=18 \\362@_{/=9.6 0}^{/=12 x}} \\
                      {/Helvetica e^{-{/Symbol m}^2/2} d}{/Symbol m}'
     
</pre>
   <p>The file "ps_guide.ps" in the /docs/psdoc subdirectory of the gnuplot source
distribution contains more examples of the enhanced syntax.
