`Gnuplot` is a portable command-line driven graphing utility for Linux, OS/2,
MS Windows, OSX, VMS, and many other platforms. The source code is copyrighted
but freely distributed (i.e., you don't have to pay for it). It was originally
created to allow scientists and students to visualize mathematical functions
and data interactively, but has grown to support many non-interactive uses
such as web scripting. It is also used as a plotting engine by third-party
applications like Octave. Gnuplot has been supported and under active
development since 1986.

   <p>Gnuplot supports many types of plots in either 2D and 3D. It can draw using
lines, points, boxes, contours, vector fields, surfaces, and various
associated text. It also supports various specialized plot types.

   <p>Gnuplot supports many different types of output: interactive screen terminals
(with mouse and hotkey input), direct output to pen plotters or modern
printers, and output to many file formats (eps, fig, jpeg, LaTeX, metafont,
pbm, pdf, png, postscript, svg, ...). Gnuplot is easily extensible to include
new output modes. Recent additions include interactive terminals based on
aquaterm (OSX) and wxWidgets (multiple platforms).

   <p>The command language of `gnuplot` is case sensitive, i.e. commands and
function names written in lowercase are not the same as those written in
capitals. All command names may be abbreviated as long as the abbreviation is
not ambiguous. Any number of commands may appear on a line, separated by
semicolons (;). Strings may be set off by either single or double quotes,
although there are some subtle differences.  See `syntax` and `quotes` for
more details. Examples:

<pre class="example">           load "filename"
           cd 'dir'
     
</pre>
   <p>Many `gnuplot` commands have multiple options. Version 4 is less sensitive
to the order of these options than earlier versions, but some order-dependence
remains. If you see error messages about unrecognized options, please try
again using the exact order listed in the documentation.

   <p>Commands may extend over several input lines by ending each line but the last
with a backslash (\).  The backslash must be the _last_ character on each
line.  The effect is as if the backslash and newline were not there.  That
is, no white space is implied, nor is a comment terminated.  Therefore,
commenting out a continued line comments out the entire command
(see `comments`).  But note that if an error occurs somewhere on a multi-line
command, the parser may not be able to locate precisely where the error is
and in that case will not necessarily point to the correct line.

   <p>In this document, curly braces ({}) denote optional arguments and a vertical
bar (|) separates mutually exclusive choices.  `Gnuplot` keywords or <a href="help.html#help">help</a>
topics are indicated by backquotes or `boldface` (where available).  Angle
brackets (&lt;&gt;) are used to mark replaceable tokens.  In many cases, a default
value of the token will be taken for optional arguments if the token is
omitted, but these cases are not always denoted with braces around the angle
brackets.

   <p>For built-in help on any topic, type <a href="help.html#help">help</a> followed by the name of the topic
or `help ?` to get a menu of available topics.

   <p>The new `gnuplot` user should begin by reading about `plotting` (if in an
interactive session, type `help plotting`).

   <p>See the simple.dem demo, also available together with other demos on the web page
<a href="http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/">http://www.gnuplot.info/demo/</a>
`Gnuplot` can be started from a command line or from an icon according to the
desktop environment. Running it from command line can take the syntax
<pre class="example">           gnuplot {OPTIONS} file1 file2 ...
</pre>
   <p>where file1, file2, etc. are input file as in the `load` command. 
On X11-based systems, you can use
<pre class="example">           gnuplot {X11OPTIONS} {OPTIONS} file1 file2 ...
</pre>
   <p>see your X11 documentation or rather `x11` in this document.

   <p>Options interpreted by gnuplot may come anywhere on the line.  Files are
executed in the order specified, as are commands supplied by the -e option,
for example
<pre class="example">           gnuplot   file1.in   -e "reset"   file2.in
     
</pre>
   <p>The special filename "-" is used to force reading from stdin.  `Gnuplot` exits
after the last file is processed.  If no load files are named, `Gnuplot` takes
interactive input from stdin.  See help `batch/interactive` for more details. 
The options specific to gnuplot can be listed by typing
<pre class="example">           gnuplot --help
</pre>
   <p>See `command line options` for more details.

   <p>Hit 'h' for help about `hotkeys` and `mousing` features in interactive screen
terminals (`pm`, `windows`, `wxt`, `x11`).
