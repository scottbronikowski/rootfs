The command `set mouse` enables mouse actions. Currently the pm, x11, ggi,
windows and wxt terminals are mouse enhanced. There are two mouse modes. The
2d-graph mode works for 2d graphs and for maps (i.e. splots with <a href="view.html#view">view</a>
having z-rotation 0, 90, 180, 270 or 360 degrees, including `set view map`)
and it allows tracing the position over graph, zooming, annotating graph etc. 
For 3d graphs `splot`, the view and scaling of the graph can be changed with
mouse buttons 1 and 2. If additionally to these buttons the modifier &lt;ctrl&gt; is
hold down, the coordinate system only is rotated which is useful for large
data sets. A vertical motion of Button 2 with the shift key hold down changes
the <a href="xyplane.html#xyplane">xyplane</a>.

   <p>Mousing is not available in multiplot mode. When multiplot is finished using
<a href="multiplot.html#multiplot">multiplot</a>, then the mouse will be turned on again and acts on the
last plot (like replot does).

   <p>Syntax:
<pre class="example">           set mouse {doubleclick &lt;ms&gt;} {nodoubleclick} \
                     {{no}zoomcoordinates} \
                     {noruler | ruler {at x,y}} \
                     {polardistance{deg|tan} | nopolardistance} \
                     {format &lt;string&gt;} \
                     {clipboardformat &lt;int&gt;/&lt;string&gt;} \
                     {mouseformat &lt;int&gt;/&lt;string&gt;} \
                     {{no}labels {"labeloptions"}} \
                     {{no}zoomjump} {{no}verbose}
           unset mouse
     
</pre>
   <p>The doubleclick resolution is given in milliseconds and used for Button 1
which copies the current mouse position to the `clipboard`. If you want that
to be done by single clicking a value of 0 ms can be used. The default value
is 300 ms.

   <p>The option `zoomcoordinates` determines if the coordinates of the zoom box are
drawn at the edges while zooming. This is on by default.

   <p>The options `noruler` and `ruler` switch the ruler off and on, the
latter optionally setting the origin at the given coordinates. While
the ruler is on, the distance in user units from the ruler origin to
the mouse is displayed continuously. By default, toggling the ruler
has the key binding 'r'.

   <p>The option `polardistance` determines if the distance between the mouse cursor
and the ruler is also shown in polar coordinates (distance and angle in
degrees or tangent (slope)). This corresponds to the default key binding '5'.

   <p>The `format` option takes a fprintf like format string which determines how
floating point numbers are printed to the drivers window and the clipboard. 
The default is "% #g".

   <p>`clipboardformat` and `mouseformat` are used for formatting the text on
Button1 and Button2 actions &ndash; copying the coordinates to the clipboard and
temporarily annotating the mouse position. This corresponds to the key
bindings '1', '2', '3', '4' (see the driver's documentation). If the argument
is a string this string is used as c format specifier and should contain two
float specifiers, e.g. `set mouse mouseformat "mouse = %5.2g, %10.2f"`. Use
`set mouse mouseformat ""` to turn this string off again.

   <p>The following formats are available (format 6 may only be selected if the
format string was specified already):

<pre class="example">      0   real coordinates in  brackets e.g. [1.23, 2.45]
      1   real coordinates w/o brackets e.g.  1.23, 2.45
      2   x == timefmt                       [(as set by <a href="timefmt.html#timefmt">timefmt</a>), 2.45]
      3   x == date                          [31. 12. 1999, 2.45]
      4   x == time                          [23:59, 2.45]
      5   x == date / time                   [31. 12. 1999 23:59, 2.45]
      6   alt. format, specified as string   ""
     
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-labels-484"></a>
Choose the option <a href="labels.html#labels">labels</a> to define persistent gnuplot labels using Button 2. 
The default is `nolabels`, which makes Button 2 draw only a temporary label at
the mouse position. Labels are drawn with the current setting of `mouseformat`. 
The `labeloptions` string is passed to the `set label` command.  The default is
"point pointstyle 1" which will plot a small plus at the label position. 
Temporary labels will disappear at the next <a href="replot.html#replot">replot</a> or mouse zoom operation. 
Persistent labels can be removed by holding the Ctrl-Key down while clicking
Button 2 on the label's point. The threshold for how close you must be to the
label is also determined by the <a href="pointsize.html#pointsize">pointsize</a>.

   <p>If the option `zoomjump` is on, the mouse pointer will be automatically
offset a small distance after starting a zoom region with button 3. This can
be useful to avoid a tiny (or even empty) zoom region. `zoomjump` is off by
default.

   <p>If the option `verbose` is turned on the communication commands are shown
during execution. This option can also be toggled by hitting `6` in the
driver's window. `verbose` is off by default.

   <p>Press 'h' in the driver's window for a short summary of the mouse and key
bindings.  This will also display user defined bindings or `hotkeys` which
can be defined using the `bind` command, see help for `bind`.  Note, that user
defined `hotkeys` may override the default bindings.

   <p>Press 'q' in the driver's window to close the window. This key cannot be
overridden with the `bind` command.

   <p>See also help for `bind` and `label`.
