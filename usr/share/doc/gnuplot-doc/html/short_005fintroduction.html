<a href="fit.html#fit">fit</a> is used to find a set of parameters that 'best' fits your data to your
user-defined function.  The fit is judged on the basis of the sum of the
squared differences or 'residuals' (SSR) between the input data points and
the function values, evaluated at the same places.  This quantity is often
called 'chisquare' (i.e., the Greek letter chi, to the power of 2).  The
algorithm attempts to minimize SSR, or more precisely, WSSR, as the residuals
are 'weighted' by the input data errors (or 1.0) before being squared;
see `fit error_estimates` for details.

   <p>That's why it is called 'least-squares fitting'.  Let's look at an example
to see what is meant by 'non-linear', but first we had better go over some
terms.  Here it is convenient to use z as the dependent variable for
user-defined functions of either one independent variable, z=f(x), or two
independent variables, z=f(x,y).  A parameter is a user-defined variable
that <a href="fit.html#fit">fit</a> will adjust, i.e., an unknown quantity in the function
declaration.  Linearity/non-linearity refers to the relationship of the
dependent variable, z, to the parameters which <a href="fit.html#fit">fit</a> is adjusting, not of
z to the independent variables, x and/or y.  (To be technical, the
second {and higher} derivatives of the fitting function with respect to
the parameters are zero for a linear least-squares problem).

   <p>For linear least-squares (LLS), the user-defined function will be a sum of
simple functions, not involving any parameters, each multiplied by one
parameter.  NLLS handles more complicated functions in which parameters can
be used in a large number of ways.  An example that illustrates the
difference between linear and nonlinear least-squares is the Fourier series. 
One member may be written as
<pre class="example">          z=a*sin(c*x) + b*cos(c*x).
</pre>
   <p>If a and b are the unknown parameters and c is constant, then estimating
values of the parameters is a linear least-squares problem.  However, if
c is an unknown parameter, the problem is nonlinear.

   <p>In the linear case, parameter values can be determined by comparatively
simple linear algebra, in one direct step.  However LLS is a special case
which is also solved along with more general NLLS problems by the iterative
procedure that `gnuplot` uses.  <a href="fit.html#fit">fit</a> attempts to find the minimum by doing
a search.  Each step (iteration) calculates WSSR with a new set of parameter
values.  The Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm selects the parameter values for
the next iteration.  The process continues until a preset criterion is met,
either (1) the fit has "converged" (the relative change in WSSR is less than
FIT_LIMIT), or (2) it reaches a preset iteration count limit, FIT_MAXITER
(see <a href="variables.html#variables">variables</a>).  The fit may also be interrupted
and subsequently halted from the keyboard (see <a href="fit.html#fit">fit</a>).  The user variable
FIT_CONVERGED contains 1 if the previous fit command terminated due to
convergence; it contains 0 if the previous fit terminated for any other
reason.

   <p>Often the function to be fitted will be based on a model (or theory) that
attempts to describe or predict the behaviour of the data.  Then <a href="fit.html#fit">fit</a> can
be used to find values for the free parameters of the model, to determine
how well the data fits the model, and to estimate an error range for each
parameter.  See `fit error_estimates`.

   <p>Alternatively, in curve-fitting, functions are selected independent of
a model (on the basis of experience as to which are likely to describe
the trend of the data with the desired resolution and a minimum number
of parameters*functions.)  The <a href="fit.html#fit">fit</a> solution then provides an analytic
representation of the curve.

   <p>However, if all you really want is a smooth curve through your data points,
the <a href="smooth.html#smooth">smooth</a> option to `plot` may be what you've been looking for rather
than <a href="fit.html#fit">fit</a>.
