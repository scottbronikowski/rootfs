   <p>The `wxt` terminal device generates output in a separate window. The window
is created by the wxWidgets library, where the 'wxt' comes from. The actual
drawing is done via cairo, a 2D graphics library, and pango, a library for
laying out and rendering text.

   <p>Syntax:
<pre class="example">             set term wxt {&lt;n&gt;}
                          {size &lt;width&gt;,&lt;height&gt;}
                          {{no}enhanced}
                          {font &lt;font&gt;}
                          {title "title"}
                          {dashed|solid} {dashlength &lt;dl&gt;}
                          {{no}persist}
                          {{no}raise}
                          {{no}ctrl}
                          {close}
     
</pre>
   <p>Multiple plot windows are supported: `set terminal wxt &lt;n&gt;` directs the
output to plot window number n.

   <p>The default window title is based on the window number. This title can also
be specified with the keyword "title".

   <p>Plot windows remain open even when the `gnuplot` driver is changed to a
different device.  A plot window can be closed by pressing the letter 'q'
while that window has input focus, by choosing `close` from a window
manager menu, or with `set term wxt &lt;n&gt; close`.

   <p>The size of the plot area is given in pixels, it defaults to 640x384. 
In addition to that, the actual size of the window also includes the space
reserved for the toolbar and the status bar. 
When you resize a window, the plot is immediately scaled to fit in the
new size of the window. Unlike other interactive terminals, the `wxt`
terminal scales the whole plot, including fonts and linewidths, and keeps
its global aspect ratio constant, leaving an empty space painted in gray. 
If you type <a href="replot.html#replot">replot</a>, click the <a href="replot.html#replot">replot</a> icon in the terminal toolbar or
type a new `plot` command, the new plot will completely fit in the window
and the font size and the linewidths will be reset to their defaults.

   <p>The active plot window (the one selected by `set term wxt &lt;n&gt;`) is
interactive. Its behaviour is shared with other terminal types. See `mouse`
for details. It also has some extra icons, which are supposed to be
self-explanatory.

   <p>This terminal supports an enhanced text mode, which allows font and other
formatting commands (subscripts, superscripts, etc.) to be embedded in labels
and other text strings. The enhanced text mode syntax is shared with other
gnuplot terminal types. See `enhanced` for more details.

   <p>&lt;font&gt; is in the format "FontFace,FontSize", i.e. the face and the size
comma-separated in a single string. FontFace is a usual font face name, such
as \'Arial\'. If you do not provide FontFace, the wxt terminal will use
\'Sans\'. FontSize is the font size, in points. If you do not provide it,
the wxt terminal will use a size of 10 points.
<pre class="example">        For example :
           set term wxt font "Arial,12"
           set term wxt font "Arial" # to change the font face only
           set term wxt font ",12" # to change the font size only
           set term wxt font "" # to reset the font name and size
     
</pre>
   <p>The fonts are retrieved from the usual fonts subsystems. Under Windows,
those fonts are to be found and configured in the entry "Fonts" of the
control panel. Under UNIX, they are handled by "fontconfig".

   <p>Pango, the library used to layout the text, is based on utf-8. Thus, the wxt
terminal has to convert from your encoding to utf-8. The default input
encoding is based on your \'locale\'. If you want to use another encoding,
make sure gnuplot knows which one you are using. See <a href="encoding.html#encoding">encoding</a> for more
details.

   <p>Pango may give unexpected results with fonts that do not respect the unicode
mapping. With the Symbol font, for example, the wxt terminal will use the map
provided by http://www.unicode.org/ to translate character codes to unicode. 
Pango will do its best to find a font containing this character, looking for
your Symbol font, or other fonts with a broad unicode coverage, like the
DejaVu fonts. Note that "the Symbol font" is to be understood as the Adobe
Symbol font, distributed with Acrobat Reader as "SY______.PFB". 
Alternatively, the OpenSymbol font, distributed with OpenOffice.org as
"opens___.ttf", offers the same characters. Microsoft has distributed a
Symbol font ("symbol.ttf"), but it has a different character set with
several missing or moved mathematic characters. If you experience problems
with your default setup (if the demo enhancedtext.dem is not displayed
properly for example), you probably have to install one of the Adobe or
OpenOffice Symbol fonts, and remove the Microsoft one. 
Other non-conform fonts, such as "wingdings" have been observed working.

   <p>The rendering of the plot can be altered with a dialog available from the
toolbar. To obtain the best output possible, the rendering involves three
mechanisms : antialiasing, oversampling and hinting. 
Antialiasing allows to display non-horizontal and non-vertical lines
smoother. 
Oversampling combined with antialiasing provides subpixel accuracy,
so that gnuplot can draw a line from non-integer coordinates. This avoids
wobbling effects on diagonal lines ('plot x' for example). 
Hinting avoids the blur on horizontal and vertical lines caused by
oversampling. The terminal will snap these lines to integer coordinates so
that a one-pixel-wide line will actually be drawn on one and only one pixel.

   <p>By default, the window is raised to the top of your desktop when a plot is
drawn. This can be controlled with the keyword "raise". 
The keyword "persist" will prevent gnuplot from exiting before you
explicitely close all the plot windows. 
Finally, by default the key &lt;space&gt; raises the gnuplot console window, and
'q' closes the plot window. The keyword "ctrl" allows you to replace those
bindings by &lt;ctrl&gt;+&lt;space&gt; and &lt;ctrl&gt;+'q', respectively. 
These three keywords (raise, persist and ctrl) can also be set and remembered
between sessions through the configuration dialog."
