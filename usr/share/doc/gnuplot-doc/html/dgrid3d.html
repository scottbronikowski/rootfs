The <a href="dgrid3d.html#dgrid3d">dgrid3d</a> command enables, and can set parameters for, non-grid to
grid data mapping.  See `splot grid_data` for more details about the grid data
structure.

   <p>Syntax:
<pre class="example">           set dgrid3d {&lt;rows&gt;} {,{&lt;cols&gt;}}
                       { splines |
                         qnorm {&lt;norm&gt;} |
                         (gauss | cauchy | exp | box | hann) {&lt;dx&gt;} {,dy} }
           unset dgrid3d
           show dgrid3d
     
</pre>
   <p>By default <a href="dgrid3d.html#dgrid3d">dgrid3d</a> is disabled.  When enabled, 3D data read from a file
are always treated as a scattered data set.  A grid with dimensions derived
from a bounding box of the scattered data and size as specified by the
row/col_size parameters is created for plotting and contouring.  The grid
is equally spaced in x (rows) and in y (columns); the z values are computed
as weighted averages or spline interpolations of the scattered points' z
values. In other words, a regularly spaced grid is created and the a smooth
approximation to the raw data is evaluated for all grid points. Only this
approximation is plotted, but not the raw data.

   <p>The number of columns defaults to the number of rows, which defaults to 10.

   <p>Several algorithms are available to calculate the approximation from the
raw data. Some of these algorithms can take additional parameters. 
These interpolations are such the closer the data point is to a grid point,
the more effect it has on that grid point.

   <p>The `splines` algorithm calculates an interpolation based on "thin plate
splines". It does not take additional paramaters.

   <p>The `qnorm` algorithm calculates a weighted average of the input data at
each grid point. Each data point is
weighted inversely by its distance from the grid point raised to the norm
power.  (Actually, the weights are given by the inverse of dx^norm + dy^norm,
where dx and dy are the components of the separation of the grid point from
each data point.  For some norms that are powers of two, specifically 4, 8,
and 16, the computation is optimized by using the Euclidean distance in the
weight calculation, (dx^2+dy^2)^norm/2.  However, any non-negative integer
can be used.) The power of the norm can be specified as a single optional
parameter. This algorithm is the default.

   <p>Finally, several smoothing kernels are available to calculate weighted
averages: z = Sum_i w(d_i) * z_i / Sum_i w(d_i), where z_i is the value
of the i-th data point and d_i is the distance between the current grid
point and the location of the i-th data point. All kernels assign higher
weights to data points that are close to the current grid point and lower
weights to data points further away.

   <p>The following kernels are available:
<pre class="example">           gauss :     w(d) = exp(-d*d)
           cauchy :    w(d) = 1/(1 + d*d)
           exp :       w(d) = exp(-d)
           box :       w(d) = 1                     if d&lt;1
                            = 0                     otherwise
           hann :      w(d) = 0.5*(1-cos(2*pi*d))   if d&lt;1
                       w(d) = 0                     otherwise
     
</pre>
   <p>When using one of these five smoothing kernels, up to two additional
parameter can be specified: dx and dy. These are used to rescale the
coordinate differences when calculating the distance:
d_i = sqrt( ((x-x_i)/dx)**2 + ((y-y_i)/dy)**2 ), where x,y are the
coordinates of the current grid point and x_i,y_i are the coordinates
of the i-th data point. The value of dy defaults to the value of dx,
which defaults to 1. The parameters dx and dy make it possible to
control the radius over which data points contribute to a grid point
IN THE UNITS OF THE DATA ITSELF.

   <p>A slightly different syntax is also supported for reasons of backwards
compatibility. If no interpolation algorithm has been explicitly selected,
the `qnorm` algorithm is assumed. Up to three comma-separated, optional
paramaters can be specified, which are interpreted as the the number of
rows, the number of columns, and the norm value, respectively.

   <p>The <a href="dgrid3d.html#dgrid3d">dgrid3d</a> option is a simple scheme which replaces scattered data
with weighted averages on a regular grid.More sophisticated approaches
to this problem exist and should be used to preprocess the data outside
`gnuplot` if this simple solution is found inadequate.
