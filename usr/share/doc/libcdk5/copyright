This Debian package of libcdk was initially put together by Raphael
Bossek <bossekr@debian.org>; later maintainers are listed in the
changelog file.

The sources were downloaded from http://invisible-island.net/cdk/

Modifications copyright Thomas Dickey 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005

The software and documentation are still under the same licensing are the
original Cdk, but noting that substantial work and enhancements have been made,
I've added my name as needed -TD

The original COPYING file follows (with corrections as noted in CHANGES).
