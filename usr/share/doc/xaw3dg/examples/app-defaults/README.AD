Sample resource files for Xaw3d-based applications.

THESE ARE NOT GLOBAL RESOURCE FILES. Put these in $(HOME)/app-defaults,
or whatever the environment variables XAPPLRESDIR, XENVIRONMENT, or
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH might point to (they're supposed to specify an user-
dependant resource file or directory).
