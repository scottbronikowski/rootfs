Xaw3D for Debian
----------------

Xaw3d is not a transparent substitute of libXaw for various
incompatibilities. All programs which want a 3d look for Xaw
toolkit, need to link explicitly against this library and manage
minor problems properly.

Some hacks have been applied to upstream sources. This library is currently 
not maintained upstream.

You can find other information about the beast in README.XAW3D.
