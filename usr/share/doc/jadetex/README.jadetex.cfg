You can put a file jadetex.cfg if you want to override jadetex's or
pdfjadtex's default behavior.  It seems that pretty much any TeX code
can go in there, but here are some common things.

This file just goes in whatever the current directory where jadetex is
being run from.


* Two-Sided Pages

Sometimes, you will want JadeTeX will start chapters and such on the
recto side, and try to keep the total count of pages even.  Note that
this used to be the default, but no longer is.  If you want to turn
that back on, put this in jadetex.cfg:

\def\PageTwoSide{1}
\def\TwoSideStartOnRight{1}


* Not Labelling Elements

In some cases, it is possible for pdfjadetex to error out even with
expanded texmf.cnf settings.  The sign of this is that jadetex is able
to process the file, but pdfjadetex isn't.  The upstream maintainer,
Sebastian Rahtz, had this to say:

| pdfjadetex _can_ go over a string limit in TeX
| which *isn't* changeable in texmf.cnf. The workaround is to write a
| file called jadetex.cfg, containing just the line
|
| \LabelElementsfalse
|
| and see if that helps. it stops jadetex from using up a string for
| every element. If that leaves unsatisfied cross-references, try
| "jadetex" instead of "pdfjadetex", and create your PDF in another via
| (ie via Distiller).



* PDF Outlines

PDF outlines are a nested list of the hierarchy of chapters, sections,
etc.  These will display on the left side using 'acroread' for
instance.

Put this in jadetex.cfg:

  pdfpagemode=UseOutlines

This functionality requires the use of OpenJade.
