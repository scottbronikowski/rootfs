This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of lpr, the BSD line
printing spool system.

This package is maintained by Adam Klein <aklein@debian.org>.

This version of lpr is taken from OpenBSD, and was obtained via CVS from
anoncvs.usa.openbsd.org.

It also includes, from OpenBSD, the getcap.c file, which is part of the
OpenBSD C library.  It has been edited to remove its dependency on libdb.

The printcap.5 manpage is also from them.

The lpr package is distributed under the BSD licence. On Debian
systems this licence is available in the file /usr/share/common-licenses/BSD.
