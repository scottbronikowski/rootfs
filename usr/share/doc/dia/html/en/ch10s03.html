      Now that you've seen what are the basics of manipulating layers, you will more easily 
      understand why <span class="emphasis"><em>layers</em></span> are such a powerful tool when you are 
      building and maintaining diagrams with <span class="application">Dia</span>.
    </p><p>
      Understanding what layers are for can dramatically improve the quality and the visual 
      effect your diagrams will produce.
    </p><p>
      For instance, imagine you are building a diagram with lots of objects in it, like an 
      Electrical or UML diagram, if you drop all of your objects in the same layer, meaning 
      the background, after a while you will get a huge unmanageable draft you won't be able 
      to do anything with it. It will be a pain to change anything in it, you will waste time 
      trying to remember what object is connected to that object which seems to take all the 
      space in the middle of the mixed up objects you already put there.
    </p><p>
      Since <span class="application">Dia</span> is a <span class="emphasis"><em>Structured Diagram Builder</em></span>, 
      all the diagrams you will build with it will be naturally structured and broken down to 
      many little pieces. Using a layered approach better manages lots of pieces with more ease 
      and efficiency than you could do with a single monolithic block of objects.

        By definition, a diagram should be structured. So breaking it down into several logical 
	parts should be an easy process. That's where <span class="emphasis"><em>layers</em></span> become a 
	very useful and important tool for the management of the content of diagrams. They 
	allow you to isolate each of these parts in separated slides, so it becomes a real 
	pleasure to manipulate them in any way you like.

      The <span class="guibutton">Eye Icon</span> to the left of the layer name is what make layers 
      so useful. It allows you to show or hide the corresponding layer. Meaning if for any 
      reason you decided to not show a particular layer, simply click on the 
      <span class="guibutton">Eye Icon</span> and the layer and everything it contains will disappear 
      from the Canvas. If you hold down the Shift key and click <span class="guibutton">Eye Icon</span> 
      you can hide all the other layers except for the current layer, and if you click again 
      while still holding the Shift key all Layers will be shown again. 
    </p><p>
      Viewing only certain layers is really useful when you want manipulate a small part of 
      your diagram without affecting the rest. Some users create separate layers to hold all 
      their text objects and use different layers to hold translations into other languages. 
      You can also work that way if you want to print your diagram on different pages or 
      testing different settings which can affect the layout of that part. 
      Again, feel free to experiment with layers, if set up properly they can make your 
      diagram look much better.

        In <span class="application">Dia</span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Layers</em></span> creation and 
        manipulation are as common as drawing or selecting objects in the diagram. 
        You must get your hands on them, because you will probably have to use 
        them anytime you will want to create a new diagram.
