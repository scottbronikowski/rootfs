imagej for Debian
-----------------

Still have some problem with luts as files are binary so for the moment are
base64 encoded but i've to write something in rules to base64 decode all luts file
before copying them, maybe somthing like:
perl -MMIME::Base64 -e 'print decode_base64(join("", <>))' < debian/extra/luts/*.enc > $(CURDIR)/debian/imagej/usr/share/imagej/luts/
need help :)
