To use this package you need to do one of the following:
1.) Install Mozilla::CA directly from CPAN.
2.) Turn off certificate verification.
3.) Specify your own certificate location.
A future release of this package will be patched as per #619059
to use the Debian certificates by default. Mozilla::CA will not
be distributed by Debian as it duplicates existing packages.
