    This list of frequently asked questions about GNU Emacs with
    answers ("FAQ") may be translated into other languages,
    transformed into other formats (e.g. Texinfo, Info, WWW, WAIS),
    and updated with new information.

    The same conditions apply to any derivative of the FAQ as apply to
    the FAQ itself.  Every copy of the FAQ must include this notice or
    an approved translation, information on who is currently
    maintaining the FAQ and how to contact them (including their
    e-mail address), and information on where the latest version of
    the FAQ is archived (including FTP information).

    The FAQ may be copied and redistributed under these conditions,
    except that the FAQ may not be embedded in a larger literary work
    unless that work itself allows free copying and redistribution.
