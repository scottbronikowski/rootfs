This is Debian GNU/Linux's prepackaged version of the FSF's Revision
Control System (RCS) utilities.  These utilities allow you to keep
multiple revisions of one or more files in a very compact manner.  RCS
is similar to, and in most respects better than, the non-free Source
Code Control System (SCCS).

This package was assembled by Sven Rudolph <sr1@inf.tu-dresden.de>
from the GNU sources available from prep.ai.mit.edu (and its numerous
mirrors) as /pub/gnu/rcs-5.7.tar.gz. It is currently maintained by
Romain Francoise <rfrancoise@debian.org>.
