>&#13;	The packets transmitted on the bus are acknowledged by the receiving end
	unless they are broadcast packets (broadcast writes and isochronous
	packets).  The acknowledge code contains an error code, which either
	signifies error, success or packet pending.  In the first two cases the
	transaction completes, in the last a response packet will follow at a
	later time from the targetted node to the source node (this is called a
	split transaction).  Only writes can succeed and complete in the ack
	code, reads and locks require a response.  Error and packet pending can
	happen for every transaction.  The response packets contain a response
	code (rcode) which signifies success or type of error.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	For read and write there are two different types, quadlet and block.
	The quadlet types have all their payload (exactly one quadlet) in the
	packet header, the block types have a variable length data block
	appended to the header.  Programs using libraw1394 don't have to care
	about that, quadlet transactions are automatically used when the data
	length is 4 bytes and block transactions otherwise.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	The lock transaction has several extended transaction codes defined
	which choose the atomic operation to perform, the most used being the
	compare-and-swap (code 0x2).  The transaction passes the data value and
	(depending on the operation) the arg value to the target node and
	returns the old value at the target address, but only when the
	transaction does not have an error.  All three values are of the same
	size, either one quadlet or one octlet.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	In the compare-and-swap case, the data value is written to the target
	address if the old value is identical to the arg value.  The old value
	is returned in any case and can be used to find out whether the swap
	succeeded by repeating the compare locally.  Compare-and-swap
	is useful for avoiding race conditions when accessing the same
	address from multiple nodes.  For example, isochronous resource
	allocation is done using compare-and-swap, as described below.  Since
	the old value is always returned, it more efficient to do the first
	attempt with the reset value of the target register as arg instead of
	reading it first.  Repeat with the returned old value as new arg value
	if it didn't succeed.
