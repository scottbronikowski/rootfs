><P
>&#13;	Nodes can allocate a channel and bandwidth for isochronous transmissions
	at the iso manager to broadcast timing critical data (e.g. multimedia
	streams) on the bus.  However these transmissions are unreliable, there
	is no guarantee that every packet reaches the intended recipients (the
	software and hardware involved also take iso packets a bit more
	lightly).  After a cycle start packet, the isochronous cycle begins and
	every node can transmit iso packets, however only one packet per channel
	is allowed.  As soon as a gap of a certain length appears (i.e. no node
	sends anymore), the iso cycle ends and the rest of the time until the
	next cycle start is reserved for asynchronous packets.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	The channel register on the iso manager consists of 64 bits, each of
	which signifies one channel.  A channel can be allocated by any node by
	doing a compare-swap lock request with the new bitmask.  Likewise the
	bandwidth can be allocated by doing a lock request with the new value.
	The bandwidth register contains the remaining time available for every
	iso cycle.  Since you allocate time, the maximum data you are allowed to
	put into an iso packet depends on the speed you will send at.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	On every bus reset, the resource registers are resetted to their initial
	values (all channels free, all bandwidth minus some amount set aside for
	asynchronous communication available), this has to happen since the
	isochronous manager may have moved to another node.  Isochronous
	transmissions may continue with the old allocations for 1000ms. During
	that time, the nodes have to reallocate	their resources and no new
	allocations are allowed to occur.  Only after this period new
	allocations may be done, this avoids nodes losing their	allocations over
	a bus reset.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	libraw1394 does not provide special functions for allocating iso
	resources nor does it clean up after programs when they exit.  Protocols
	exist that require the first node to use some resources to allocate it
	and then leave it for the last node using it to deallocate it.  This may
	be different nodes, so automatic behaviour would be very undesirable in
	these cases.
