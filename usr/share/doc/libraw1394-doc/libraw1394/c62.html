>&#13;	The 1394 subsystem in Linux is divided into the classical
	three layers, like most other interface subsystems in Linux.
	The in-kernel subsystem consists of the ieee1394 core, which
	provides basic services like handling of the 1394 protocol
	(converting the abstract transactions into packets and back),
	collecting information about bus and nodes and providing some
	services to the bus that are required to be available for
	standards conformant nodes (e.g. CSR registers).  Below that
	are the hardware drivers, which handle converting packets and
	bus events to and from hardware accesses on specific 1394
	chipsets.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	Above the core are the highlevel drivers, which use the services
	provided by the core to implement protocols for certain devices and act
	as drivers to these.  raw1394 is one such driver, however it is not
	specialized to handle one kind of device but is designed to accept
	commands from user space to do any transaction wanted (as far as
	possible from current core design).  Using raw1394, normal applications
	can access 1394 nodes on the bus and it is not neccessary to write
	kernel code just for that.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	raw1394 communicates to user space like most device drivers do, through
	device files in /dev.  It uses a defined protocol on that device, but
	applications don't have to and should not care about that.  All of this
	is taken care of by libraw1394, which provides a set of functions that
	convert to and from raw1394 protocol packets and are a lot easier to
	handle than that underlying protocol.
