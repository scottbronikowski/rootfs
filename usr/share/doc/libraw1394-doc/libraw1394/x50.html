>2.4. Bus Management</A
></H1
><P
>&#13;	There are three basic bus service nodes defined in IEEE 1394 (higher
	level protocols may define more): cycle master, isochronous resource
	manager and bus manager.  These positions are contended for in and
	shortly after the bus reset and may all be taken by a single node.  A
	node does not have to support being any of those but if it is bus
	manager capable it also has to be iso manager capable, if it is iso
	manager capable it also has to be cycle master capable.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	The cycle master sends 8000 cycle start packets per second, which
	initiate an iso cycle.  Without that, no isochronous transmission is
	possible.  Only the root node is allowed to be cycle master, if it is
	not capable then no iso transmissions can occur (and the iso or bus
	manager have to select another node to become root and initiate a bus
	reset).
      </P
><P
>&#13;	The isochronous resource manager is the central point where channel and
	bandwidth allocations are stored.  A bit in the SelfID shows whether a
	node is iso manager capable or not, the iso manager capable node with
	the highest ID wins the position after a bus reset.  Apart from
	containing allocation registers, this one doesn't do much.  Only if
	there is no bus manager, it may determine a cycle master capable node to
	become root and initiate a bus reset.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	The bus manager has more responsibilities: power management (calculate
	power provision and consumption on the bus and turn on disabled nodes if
	enough power is available), bus optimization (calculate an effective gap
	count, optimize the topology by selecting a better positioned node for
	root) and some registers relevant to topology (topology map containing
	the SelfIDs of the last reset and a speed map, which is obsoleted in
	IEEE 1394a).  The bus manager capable nodes contend for the role by
	doing a lock transaction on the bus manager ID register in the iso
	manager, the first to successfully complete the transaction wins the
	role.
