>2.2. Bus Reset</A
></H1
><P
>&#13;	A bus reset occurs whenever the state of any node changes (including
	addition and removal of nodes).  At the beginning a root node is chosen,
	then the tree identification determines for every node which port is
	connected to a parent, child or nothing.  Then the SelfID phase begins.
	The root node sends a SelfID grant on its first port connected to a
	child.  If that is not a leaf node, it will itself forward the grant to
	its first child.  When a leaf node gets a grant, it will pick the lowest
	physical ID not yet in use (starting with 0) and send out a SelfID packet
	with its physical ID and more information, then acknowledge the SelfID
	grant to its parent, which will send a grant to its next child until it
	configured all its children, then pick a physical ID itself, send SelfID
	packet and ack to parent.
      </P
><P
>&#13;	After bus reset the used physical IDs are in a sequential range with no
	holes starting from 0 up to the root node having the highest ID.  This
	also means that physical IDs can change for many or all nodes with the
	insertion of a new node or moving the role of root to another node.  In
	libraw1394 all transactions are tagged automatically with a generation
	number which is increased in every bus reset and transactions with an
	obsolete generation will fail in order to avoid targetting the wrong
	node.  Nodes have to be identified in a different way than their
	volatile physical IDs, namely by reading their globally unique ID (GUID)
	contained in the configuration ROM.
