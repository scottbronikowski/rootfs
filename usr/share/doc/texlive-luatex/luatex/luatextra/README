                          The luatextra generic bundle


LuaTeXtra is a collection of three coherent packages:

luatextra provides low-level functions for LuaTeX use with LaTeX and Plain, for
instance the macro \newluaattribute. It also provides a way to use and register
new lua modules, inspired by the LaTeX packages system.

luamcallback provides a way to register several functions in a LuaTeX callback.

luaextra provides extra lua functions useful for package development.

These packages are really necessary if you want to take advantage of the new
LuaTeX functions in a safe way.

Note that this package automatically loads luaotfload.

Please see the luatextra-reference.pdf documentation for more details.

This package is developped on <http://github.com/eroux/lualatex/tree/master>.


History
-------

2009/12/16, luatextra v0.95:
    * package can now be loaded with a different engine, it then loads only
        \LuaTeX and \LuaLaTeX
    * \CatcodeTableLaTeXAtLetter and \CatcodeTableExpl have appeared
    * short names have been added to the tex.catcodetablenumber table
    
2009/09/22, luatextra v0.94:
    * prefixing macros with \luatex instead of \lua, to be coherent with 
        TeX Live 2009.
        
2009/09/18, luamcallbacks v0.93:
    * adding the callback process_output_buffer, to use it with luainputenc

        
Installation
------------

Here are the recommended installation methods (preferred first).

1. If you are using TeX Live 2008 or later, use 'tlmgr install luatextra'.
Alternatively, try your (TeX or Linux) distribution's package management system.

2. a. Grab luatextra.tds.zip on the CTAN.
   b. Unzip it at the root of one or your TDS trees.
   c. You may need to update some filename database after this, see your TeX
distribution's manual for details.

3. a. Grab the sources from CTAN or github.
   b. Run 'make install TEXMFROOT=/path/to/texmf'.
   c. See 2c.

4. Try to figure it out by looking at the Makefile and comments in the sources.
