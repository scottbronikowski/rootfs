Example 1. Creating File and Data Annotations

This example illustrates the use of ANcreatef/affcreate to create file
annotations and ANcreate/afcreate to create data annotations.

In this example, the program creates an HDF file named
"General_HDFobjects.hdf" then attaches to it two annotations, a file
label and a file description.  Within the HDF file, the program creates
a vgroup named "AN Vgroup" and attaches to it two annotations, a data
label and a data description.  Refer to Chapter 5, titled Vgroups (V API),
for the discussion of the V interface routines used in this example.

Note that the names AN_FILE_LABEL, AN_FILE_DESC, AN_DATA_LABEL, and
AN_DATA_DESC are defined by the library to specify the type of the
annotation to be accessed.
