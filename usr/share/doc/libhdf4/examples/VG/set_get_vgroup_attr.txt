Example 5. Operations on Vgroup Attributes

This example illustrates the use of Vfind/vfind to locate a vgroup by its
name, Vsetattr/vfscatt to attach an attribute to the vgroup, Vattrinfo/vfainfo to
obtain information about the vgroup attribute, and Vgetattr/vfgcatt to obtain
the attribute values.

The program obtains the version of the group then sets an attribute
named "First Attribute" for the vgroup named "SD Vgroup".  Next, the
program gets the number of attributes that the vgroup has, and obtains
and displays the name, the number of values, and the values of each
attribute.
