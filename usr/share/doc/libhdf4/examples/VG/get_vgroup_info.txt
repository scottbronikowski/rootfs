Example 4. Obtaining Information about Lone Vgroups

This example illustrates the use of Vlone/vflone to obtain the list of
reference numbers of all lone vgroups in the file and the use of
Vgetname/vfgnam and Vgetclass/vfgcls to obtain the name and the class of a 
vgroup.

In this example, the program calls Vlone/vflone twice.  The first call is to
obtain the number of lone vgroups in the file so that sufficient space
can be allocated; the later call is to obtain the actual reference
numbers of the lone vgroups.  The program then goes through the list of
lone vgroup reference numbers to get and display the name and class of
each lone vgroup.  The file used in this example is "General_Vgroups.hdf".
