    .c     - C source code
    .f     - Fortran sorce code
    .txt   - Description of the C and Fortran example 
    .out_c - output from the C program
    .out_f - output from the Fortran program
    makec  - makefile to create C executables
             make -f makec VG

    makef  - makefile to create Fortran executables
             make -f makef VG


    The output files (.out_*) contain a program's expected output if 
    there is output or the output from the HDF hdp utility.

    Make sure that the examples are run in the proper order. Please read the
    examples' descriptions (.txt files) to get information on their
    dependencies. 
    
    The following order will guarantee the examples' correctness:
 
    create_vgroup
    add_sds_to_vgroup
    insert_vdatas_to_vgroup
    get_vgroup_info
    set_get_vgroup_attr
    vgroup_contents
