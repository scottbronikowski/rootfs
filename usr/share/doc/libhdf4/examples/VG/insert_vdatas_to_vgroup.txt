Example 3. Adding Three Vdatas to a Vgroup

This example illustrates the use of Vinsert/vfinsrt to add a vdata
to a vgroup.  Note that Vaddtagref/vfadtrf,
used in the previous example, performs the same task and only differs
in the argument list.

In this example, the program creates three vdatas and a vgroup in the
existing HDF file "General_Vgroups.hdf" then adds the three vdatas to
the vgroup.  Notice that the vdatas and the vgroup are created in the
same interface that is intialized by the call Vstart/vfstart.  The first vdata
is named "X,Y Coordinates" and has two order-1 fields of type float32.
The second vdata is named "Temperature" and has one order-1
field of type float32. The third vdata is named "Node List" and has one
order-3 field of type int16.  The vgroup is named "Vertices" and is of class
"Vertex Set".  The program uses Vinsert/vfinsrt to add the vdatas to the vgroup
using the vdata identifiers.  Refer to Chapter 4, titled Vdata (VS API),
for the discussion of the VS routines used in this example.
