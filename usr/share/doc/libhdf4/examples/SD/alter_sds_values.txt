Example 4. Altering Values within an SDS Array.

This example demonstrates how the routine SDwritedata can be used
to alter the values of the elements in the 10th and 11th rows, at the 2nd
column, in the SDS array created in the Example 1 and written in Example2.
Fortran routine sfwdata is used to alter the elements in the 2nd row, 10th
and 11th columns, to reflect the difference between C and Fortran internal
storage.
