    This directory contains the examples from the HDF User's Guide 4.1r2,
    Chapter 3 ( SDS APIs ) 

    .c     - C source code
    .f     - Fortran sorce code
    .txt   - Description of the C and Fortran example 
    .out_c - output from the C program
    .out_f - output from the Fortran program
    makec  - makefile to create C executables
             make -f makec SD

    makef  - makefile to create Fortran executables
             make -f makef SD



    The output files (.out_*) contain a program's expected output if 
    there is output or the output from the HDF hdp utility.

    Make sure that the examples are run in the proper order. Please read the
    examples' descriptions (.txt files) to get information on their
    dependencies. 
    
    The following order will guarantee the examples' correctness:

    create_sds
    write_to_sds
    write_slab
    alter_sds_values
    unlimited_sds
    mv_sds_to_external
    read_from_sds
    read_subsets
    get_info
    find_sds_by_name
    set_get_dim_info
    dimscale_vs_sds
    set_attr
    get_attr
    compress_sds
    chunking_example
