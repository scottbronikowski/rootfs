Example 13. Distinguishing Dimension Scale from the Data Set in a File.

This example illustrates the use of the routine SDiscoordvar/sfiscvar to
determine whether the selected SDS array is a data set or a dimension stored 
as an SDS array (coordinate variable) (see discussion in Section 3.8.4) and 
displays the name of the data set or dimension.
