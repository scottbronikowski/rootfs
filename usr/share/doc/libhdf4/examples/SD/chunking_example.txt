Example 16. Writing and Reading a Chunked SDS.

This example demonstrates the use of the routines SDsetchunk/sfschnk,
SDwritedata/sfwdata, SDwritechunk/sfwchnk, SDgetchunkinfo/sfgichnk,
SDreaddata/sfrdata, and SDreadchunk/sfrchnk to create a chunked data
set, write data to it, get information about the data set, and
read the data back. Note that the Fortran example uses transpose data to
reflect the difference between C and Fortran internal storage.
