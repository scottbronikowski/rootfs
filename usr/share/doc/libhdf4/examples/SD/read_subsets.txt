Example 9. Reading Subsets of an SDS.

This example shows how parameters start, stride, and edges of the routine
SDreadata/sfrdata can be used to read three subsets of an SDS array.

C:
For the first subset, the program reads every 3rd element of the 2nd column
starting at the 4th row of the data set created in Example 2 and modified in
Examples 4 and 7.
For the second subset the program reads the first 4 elements of the 10th row.
For the third subset, the program reads from the same data set every 6th 
element of each column and 4th element of each row starting at 1st column,
3d row.

Fortran: 
Fortran program reads transposed data to reflect the difference in C and
Fortran internal storage.
