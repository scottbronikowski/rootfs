Example 1. Creating an HDF File and an Empty SDS.

This example illustrates the use of SDstart/sfstart, SDcreate/sfcreate,
SDendaccess/sfendacc, and SDend/sfend to create the HDF file named SDS.hdf,
and an empty data set with the name SDStemplate in the file.

Note that the Fortran program uses a transformed array to reflect the difference
between C and Fortran internal data storages. When the actual data is written
to the data set, SDS.hdf will contain the same data regardless of the
language being used.
