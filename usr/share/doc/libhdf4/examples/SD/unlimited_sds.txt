Example 5. Appending Data to an SDS Array with an Unlimited Dimension.

This example creates a 10x10 SDS array with one unlimited dimension and writes
data to it. The file is reopened and the SDisrecord/sfisrcrd routine
is used to determine whether the selected SDS array is appendable. Then
new data is appended, starting at the 11th row.
