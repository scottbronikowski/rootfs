Example 5. Operations on File and Raster Image Attributes

This example illustrates the use of the routines GRsetattr/mgsnatt/mgscatt
to assign attributes to an HDF file and to an image.

In this example, the program sets two attributes to the existing file
"General_RImages.hdf" and two attributes to the image named "Image Array 2".
The file is created by the program in Example 1 and the image is created
by the program in Example 2.  The values of the second attribute of the
image are of type int16 and the values of the other three attributes
are of type char8.
