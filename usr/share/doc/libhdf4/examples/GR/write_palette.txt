Example 7. Writing a Palette

This example illustrates the use of the routines GRgetlutid/mggltid and 
GRwritelut/mgwclut to attach a palette to a raster image and write data 
to it.

In this example, the program creates an image named "Image with Palette" in the
file "Image_with_Palette.hdf". A palette is then attached to the image
and data is written to it.
