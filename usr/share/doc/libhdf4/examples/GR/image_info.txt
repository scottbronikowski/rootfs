Example 4. Obtaining File and Image Information

This example illustrates the use of the routines GRfileinfo/mgfinfo and
GRgetiminfo/mggiinf to obtain information such as the number of images
and attributes in an HDF file and the characteristics of a raster image in the
file.

In this example, the program gets the number of images in the
file using the routine GRfileinfo/mgfinfo. 
For each image, the program then obtains and displays its name, 
number of components, data type, interlace mode, dimension sizes, 
and number of attributes using the routine GRgetiminfo/mggiinf.
