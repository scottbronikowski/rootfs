Example 8.  Reading a Palette

This example illustrates the use of the routines GRgetlutinfo/mgglinf and
GRreadlut/mgrclut to obtain information about a palette and to read
palette data.

In this example, the program finds and selects the image named 
"Image with Palette" in the file "Image_with_Palette.hdf". 
Then the program obtains information about the palette and reads 
the palette data.
