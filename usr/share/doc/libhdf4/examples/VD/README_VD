    .c     - C source code
    .f     - Fortran sorce code
    .txt   - Description of the C and Fortran example 
    .out_c - output from the C program
    .out_f - output from the Fortran program
    makec  - makefile to create C executables
             make -f makec VD

    makef  - makefile to create Fortran executables
             make -f makef VD

    The output files (.out_*) contain a program's expected output if 
    there is output or the output from the HDF hdp utility.

    Make sure that the examples are run in the proper order. Please read the
    examples' descriptions (.txt files) to get information on their
    dependencies. 
    
    The following order will guarantee the examples' correctness:

    create_vdatas
    create_onefield_vdatas
    write_to_vdata
    write_mixed_vdata
    read_from_vdata
    read_mixed_vdata
    locate_vdata
    set_get_vdata_attr
    get_vdata_info
