Example 5.  Reading a Vdata of Homogeneous Type

This example illustrates the use of VSfind/vsffnd to locate a vdata given its
name, VSseek/vsfseek to move the current position to a desired record, and
VSread/vsfrd to read the data of several records.  The function VSfind will
be discussed in Section 4.7.3.  The approach used in this example can
only read data written by a program such as that in Example 3, i.e.,
without packing.  Reading mixed data vdatas must use the approach
illustrated in Example 6.

The program reads 5 records starting from the fourth record of the two
fields "Position" and "Temperature" in the vdata "Solid Particle" from
the file "General_Vdatas.hdf".  After the program uses VSfind/vsffnd to obtain
the reference number of the vdata, it uses VSseek/vsfseek to place the current
position at the fourth record, then starts reading 5 records, and
displays the data.
