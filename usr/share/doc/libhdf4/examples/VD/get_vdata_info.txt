Example 9. Obtaining Vdata Information

This example illustrates the use of VSgetid/vsfgid and VSinquire/vsfinq 
to obtain information about all vdatas in an HDF file.

In this example, the program uses VSgetid to locate all vdatas in the
HDF file "General_Vdatas.hdf", which is the output of Example 3.  For
each vdata found, if it is not the storage of an attribute, the program
uses VSinquire/vsfinq to obtain information about the vdata and displays its
information.  Recall that an attribute is also stored as a vdata; the 
function VSisattr/vsfisat checks whether a vdata is a storage of an attribute.
