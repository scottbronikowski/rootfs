Example 2.  Creating and Storing One-field Vdatas Using
                VHstoredata and VHstoredatam

This example illustrates the use of VHstoredata/vhfscd and VHstoredatam/vhfsdm
to create single-field vdatas.

This example creates and writes two vdatas to the file
"General_Vdatas.hdf".  The first vdata is named "First Vdata", contains 5
records, and belongs to a class named "5x1 Array".  The second vdata is
named "Second Vdata", contains 6 records, and belongs to a class named "6x4
Array".  The field of the first vdata is a single-component field,
i.e., order of 1, and named "Single-component Field".  The field of the
second vdata has an order of 4 and is named "Multi-component Field".
