Subject: Using examples from your book in a testdoc


> Hello,
> 
> I'm currently writing a testcase for the docbook-xsl Java extensions.
> The test-doc is considered to be included in the Debian package (and
> probably in the docbook SVN repository too), so I can test the package.
> Now I'm using several example you showed in your book (e.g. from
> http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/AnnotateListing.html). So my
> questions is: Am I allowed to use them and distribute the test-doc as
