Here are the few commands you need to know in order to work with
module-assistant.

Updating the cached data
========================

Do this every time after running "apt-get update", "dselect update", etc.
Run:

  module-assistant update

Listing available packages
==========================

For example, we look for available packages of ALSA. Run:

  module-assistant list alsa

To extend the list to module packages precompiled by Debian maintainers,
replace "list" with "search".

To list all packages, just say "module-assistant list" (or
"module-assistant search"). If you wish to limit the list to the
packages of which you have the source installed, use "li" instead of
"list".

Preparing to compile the own packages
=====================================

Run:

  module-assistant prepare

Building and installing packages for the own kernel
===================================================

Assuming that there is no precompiled ALSA package available for your
kernel.  Run:

  module-assistant auto-install alsa

And be patient...

For more commands and options, see the manpage of module-assistant.

How to build and sign whole series of modules:
==============================================

export SIGNCHANGES=1
export KPKG_DEST_DIR=/my/package/repository
export GNUPGHOME=~username/.gnupg
module-assistant get cdfs
module-assistant build cdfs -k "`ls -d /usr/src/linux-headers*`" -vt

alternatively, you can specify DEBSIGNCOMMAND and write your own script
to sign the changes files.
