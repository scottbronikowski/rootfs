Autoconf Archive
================

The GNU Autoconf Archive is a collection of more than 450 macros for `GNU
Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf>`_ that have been contributed as
free software by friendly supporters of the cause from all over the Internet.
Every single one of those macros can be re-used without imposing any
restrictions whatsoever on the licensing of the generated `configure` script. In
particular, it is possible to use all those macros in `configure` scripts that
are meant for non-free software. This policy is unusual for a Free Software
Foundation project. The FSF firmly believes that software ought to be free, and
software licenses like the GPL are specifically designed to ensure that
derivative work based on free software must be free as well. In case of
Autoconf, however, an exception has been made, because Autoconf is at such a
pivotal position in the software development tool chain that the benefits from
having this tool available as widely as possible outweigh the disadvantage that
some authors may choose to use it, too, for proprietary software.

The best place to start exploring the Archive is the `on-line documentation
<http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf-archive/>`_. There is also the `Autoconf
Archive home page <http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/autoconf-archive/>`_ at
Savannah.

Here are the GPG detached signatures:

* autoconf-archive-2011.09.17.tar.gz.sig_
* autoconf-archive-2011.09.17.tar.bz2.sig_
* autoconf-archive-2011.09.17.tar.xz.sig_

You can use either of the above signature files to verify that the corresponding
file (without the .sig suffix) is intact. First, be sure to download both the
.sig file and the corresponding tarball. Then, run a command like this::

  gpg --verify autoconf-archive-2011.09.17.tar.gz.sig

If that command fails because you don't have the required public key, then run
this command to import it::

  gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 99089D72

and rerun the ``gpg --verify`` command.
