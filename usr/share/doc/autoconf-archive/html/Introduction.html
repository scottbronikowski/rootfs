<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction</h2>

<p>The GNU Autoconf Archive is a collection of more than 450 macros for
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf">GNU Autoconf</a> that have been
contributed as free software by friendly supporters of the cause from all over
the Internet. Every single one of those macros can be re-used without imposing
any restrictions whatsoever on the licensing of the generated <samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp>
script. In particular, it is possible to use all those macros in
<samp><span class="file">configure</span></samp> scripts that are meant for non-free software. This policy is
unusual for a Free Software Foundation project. The FSF firmly believes that
software ought to be free, and software licenses like the GPL are specifically
designed to ensure that derivative work based on free software must be free as
well. In case of Autoconf, however, an exception has been made, because Autoconf
is at such a pivotal position in the software development tool chain that the
benefits from having this tool available as widely as possible outweigh the
disadvantage that some authors may choose to use it, too, for proprietary
software.
