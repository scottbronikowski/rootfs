Things still TODO
=================

Fix a few broken semantics (shutdown semantics are wrong, for one)
Limits on the size of the buffers
Maybe rewrite to use Event module at the core
Make it work with SSL sockets (difficult)
Benchmarking stats.
More optimizations.
More examples.
Feature to let output buffer to switch to a file
  after certain limits in order to save memory
