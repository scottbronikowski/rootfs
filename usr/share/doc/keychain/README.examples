The script keychain.xsession, placed in /etc/X11/Xsession.d/80keychain, 
will automatically configure keychain (with no keys initially loaded) for
every user with a .keychain directory.

The GPG part of this functionality needs a change to the 90gpg-agent
Xsession script from the gnupg-agent package (wishlist Bug#336480), since
currently 90gpg-agent will overwrite GPG_AGENT_INFO with that of a
replacement agent.
