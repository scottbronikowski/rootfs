This is the Debian GNU/Linux libio-stringy-perl version of the IO-stringy
package by Eryq <eryq@zeegee.com>. IO-stringy provides Perl modules for I/O
from scalar variables or arrays of scalars.

This package was put together by Dirk Eddelbuettel <edd@debian.org>
from sources obtained from 
	http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/authors/Eryq/IO-stringy-1.207.tar.gz 
It is also available from every other CPAN mirror.  Visit
	http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ 
to find a Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN) site near you.

The only change for the Debian package was the addition of the debian/
files. The package was renamed to match the Debian Policy which aims
at consistent names for Perl Module packages.
