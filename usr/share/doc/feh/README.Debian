This is the feh (graphic image viewer) packaged for the Debian 
Project.

Notable deviations from the upstream distribution:
  1. The "cam" perl script was renamed to "feh-cam" to avoid a
     naming conflict with the Debian cam package. A feh-cam(1) 
     manpage was also added.
  2. The shell script gen_cam_menu.sh was renamed to gen_cam_menu
     because attaching the script type to an executable should
     be avoided.
