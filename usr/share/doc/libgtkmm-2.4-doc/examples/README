These are C++ versions of the C demos that are distributed with gtk+.
You will probably find that they are easier to understand, because C++
allows much clearer organisation and reuse of code.

The gtk-demo contains multiple demos of functionality and APIs that are
new in gtk+2.0, and it shows the source code of the demos it is running.
