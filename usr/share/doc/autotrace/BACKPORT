Backporting notes for sarge:

 - The versioned build-dependency on libpstodit-dev is for
   orchestrating the C++ ABI transition. It can be omitted if
   you backport to a pre-transition system.

Some random notes for brave souls who want to build this package
on woody. This is not a full set of instructions; just things I have
noticed while trying to build on various mixed woody/sarge systems.

 - Most of the build-dependencies can be omitted; the configure script
   will detect that libraries are missing and build a less featureful
   autotrace. (This is not good enough for the official Debian package,
   but it might work for you locally).

 - It ought to be possible to build against woody's libmagick5-dev
   package instead of sarge's libmagick6-dev. At least rumor has it
   that they are source compatible. I don't remember if I have tried
   this myself...

 - The configure script's test for libpstoedit seems to trigger some
   bug in woody's gcc package. For pstoedit support you need to upgrade
   to a newer gcc (which will pull in a new libc and sort of defeat the
   point of backporting at all).
