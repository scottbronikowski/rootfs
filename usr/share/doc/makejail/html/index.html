<H1>Usage</H1>
<br>
<PRE>./makejail configuration_file</PRE>
<br>
<H1>Overview</H1>
<br>
The objective of makejail is to help an administrator creating and updating a chroot jail with short configuration files.<br>
Makejails attempts to guess and install into the jail all files required by the daemon.<br>
You have to understand how it works to configure it efficiently.<br>
<br>
<H1>Detailed mechanism</H1>
<br>
The list of these files is built from several sources:<br>
- the main method is to trace what files the daemon attempts to access, add them into the jail and restart again until no further file is found.<br>
- a list of files manually given in the configuration file.<br>
- the files which belongs to a package and eventually the packages it requires.<br>
<br>
When a file is added into the jail:<br>
- the shared libraries it needs (given by ldd) are added too.<br>
- upper directories are created if needed.<br>
- if the file is a symbolic link, the target is added too.<br>
- all the checks to determine what files a file needs are recursive.<br>
- all files are copied maintaining the originals' ownerships and permissions.<br>
<br>
Some files are handled with a special method:<br>
- when the file is below /proc, the procfs filesystem is mounted inside the jail.<br>
- when the file is a socket, it's not copied.<br>
- when the file is the shared library cache, it's not copied, ldconfig is run at the end.<br>
<br>
The steps of makejail are:<br>
- eventually remove the files in the jail first.<br>
- if you specified some packages, add all the files which belongs to them.<br>
- if you specified some paths to include, add the files matching these patterns.<br>
- start the daemon inside the jail, and trace it with strace, add the files it attempts to open which exist outside the jail, kill it and start again until no more file is found.<br>
- start the daemon inside the jail, and trace it while running some test processes outside the jail, see with strace what files the daemon attempts to open.<br>
<br>
<H1>Configuration files</H1>
<br>
The file must be written in a correct python syntax. The good news is that the syntax is simple, and you can eventually write some python code to define the syntax.<br>
Some default directives may be defined in /etc/makejail/makejail.conf, the configuration file given on the command line has predecence.<br>
All paths you use in the configuration file must be absolute.<br>
<br>
<H1>Configuration directives</H1>
<br>
<H2>Basics</H2>
<br>
Defaults won't work, you must define specific values for these directives.<br>
<br>
<H3>chroot</H3>
<br>
The path to the chroot. The directory must exist and have correct permissions and ownerships.<br>
<br>
Format: "/path/to/jail"<br>
<br>
Default: None<br>
<br>
<H3>testCommandsInsideJail</H3>

<br>
Default: []<br>
<br>
<H3>processNames</H3>

<br>
Format: ["process1", "process2"]<br>
<br>
Default: []<br>
<br>
<H2>Tests</H2>
<br>
After the daemon itself has been chrooted successfully, some commands can be executed from outside the jail to test the daemon.<br>
<br>
<H3>testCommandsOutsideJail</H3>
<br>
The test commands which should be executed.<br>
<br>
Format: ["command1", "command2"]<br>
<br>
Default: []<br>
<br>
<H3>promptForInteractiveTests</H3>
<br>
Whether makejail should pause so you can stress the daemon yourself.<br>
Use only if makejail is run interactively, and don't redirect its outputs.<br>
<br>
Format: 1 (prompt) or 0 (don't prompt)<br>
<br>
Default: 0<br>
<br>
<H3>promptForSomeMoreTests=0</H3>
<br>

<H2>Copying files</H2>
<br>
<H3>doNotCopy</H3>

<br>
<H3>preserve</H3>
<br>
Useful only if cleanJailFirst=1, makejail won't remove files or directories if their path begins with one of the strings in this list.<br>
When updating a jail, you should for example put the locations of log files here.<br>
<br>
Format: ["path1", "path2"]<br>
<br>
Default: []<br>
<br>
<H3>maxRemove</H3>
<br>
Useful only if cleanJailFirst=1, makejail aborts if it's about to remove more than this number of files from the jail.<br>
This may prevent makejail from erasing unwanted files if you wrote chroot="/usr" or if you have mounted a partition in the jail.<br>
<br>
Format: integer<br>
<br>
Default: 500<br>
<br>
<H3>users</H3>

<H2>Debian specific</H2>
<br>
I initially thought with starting with the package description, but this method usually installs a bunch of files you won't need.<br>

<br>
<H2>Paths so specific files and commands</H2>

<H3>pathToLdConfig</H3>
<br>
Path to the executable ldconfig, used to generate the shared libraries cache. ldconfig is executed in the jail to regenerate this cache.<br>
<br>
Format: "/path/to/ldconfig"<br>
<br>
Default: "/sbin/ldconfig" (Debian), "/sbin/ldconfig.real" (Ubuntu)<br>
<br>
<H3>pathToLdSoConf</H3>
<br>
The path to the configuration files used by ldconfig, which says which directories should be scanned searching for shared libraries.<br>
Set this to None if your system doesn't use such a file.<br>
<br>

Spaces separate the columns, the first column is numbered 1.<br>
<br>
Format: (columnPid,columnProcessName)<br>
<br>
Default: [1,4]<br>
<br>
<H2>Commands to run to trace processes</H2>
<br>
Here you can configure the commands which must be run to trace processes. These are called strace though you can use another program, like ktrace on OpenBSD.<br>
The defaults should be suitable for systems using strace. "-f" means strace should trace process children too. Though it's interested only in file accesses, it doesn't use "-e trace=file" because with this option it doesn't catch calls for "bind" and "connect" to sockets.<br>
<br>
<H3>straceCommand</H3>
<br>
String describing the strace command when executing a command line. "%command" will be replaced by the command to execute, and "%file" by the path to the temporary trace file.<br>
<br>
Format: "strace_command [options] %command > %file"<br>
<br>
Default: "strace -e trace=file,connect -e signal=none -f -ff -o %file %command >/dev/null 2>&1"<br>
<br>
<H3>straceCommandPid</H3>
<br>
String describing the strace command when attaching itself to a running process. "%pid" will be replaced by the id of the process to trace, and "%file" by the path to the temporary trace file.<br>
<br>
Format: "strace -e trace=file,connect -e signal=none -f -ff -o %file -p %pid >/dev/null 2>&1"<br>

<br>
<H3> straceCommandStop</H3>
<br>
Command to execute to stop the tracing.<br>
<br>
Format: "strace_stop_command"<br>
<br>
Default: "killall -9 strace"<br>
<br>
<H3>straceCommandView</H3>
<br>
Set this to None if the trace output files can be read directly, or the command line to execute which prints the trace on stdout. "%file" will be replaced by the name of this file.<br>
<br>
Format: "strace_command_viewer [options] %file"<br>
<br>
Default: None<br>
<br>
<H3>keepStraceOutputs</H3>
<br>
Whether makejail should remove the outputs of strace from the directory tempDir.<br>
<br>
Format: 0 (to remove the files) or 1 (to keep them)<br>
<br>
Default: 0<br>
<br>
<H2>Patterns in the trace outputs</H2>
<br>
These are three patterns which should match failed attempts to access a file in the traces.<br>
You must define a group (between parenthesis) which will be matched by the path of the file.<br>
The syntax of the regular expressions in python is detailed here: http://py-howto.sourceforge.net/regex/regex.html<br>
<br>
If the match on a line means it is a failed attempt only if the next line matches another expression (typically a return code, no group needed), you can use an array of two strings instead of one string, the first string is the main expression, and the second one is the expression which must match the next line. See global.OpenBSD in the examples directory.<br>
<br>
<H3>stracePatterns</H3>
<br>
Regular expressions to detect a failed attempt at accessing a file.<br>
If the file exists outside the jail makejail will copy it into the jail.<br>
<br>
Format: ["regexp1", "regexp2", ["regexp3", "regexp3 for the next line"]]<br>
<br>
Default: ['.*("([^"]*)",.*) .* ENOENT .*']<br>
<br>
<H3>straceCreatePatterns</H3>
<br>
Regular expressions to detect a failed attempt at creating a file.<br>
If the directory where the file should be created exists outside the jail, it will create it inside the jail.<br>
<br>
Format: ["regexp1", "regexp2", ["regexp3", "regexp3 for the next line"]]<br>
<br>
Default: ['.*("([^"]*)",.*O_CREAT.*) .* ENOENT .*','bind(.* path="([^"]*)".* ENOENT .*']<br>
<br>
<H3>straceSocketPatterns</H3>
<br>
Regular expressions to detect a failed attempt at accessing a socket.<br>
makejail can't create the socket, it will just print a warning.<br>
<br>
Format: ["regexp1", "regexp2", ["regexp3", "regexp3 for the next line"]]<br>
<br>
Default: ['connect(.* path="([^"]*)".* ENOENT .*']<br>
