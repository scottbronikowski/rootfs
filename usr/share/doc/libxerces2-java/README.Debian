Xerces2-J for Debian
====================

- Unlike Xerces-J 1.x (Debian package libxerces-java) this package contains
  two JARs in /usr/share/java/ which both need to be in your class path:
  * xercesImpl.jar contains the actual Xerces parser
  * xmlParserAPIs.jar contains the XML APIs (DOM, SAX) which are used by
    all standard XML parsers. This is a symbolic link to jaxp-1.3.jar from
    the libjaxp1.3-java package.
