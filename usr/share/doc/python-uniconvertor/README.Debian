--- Font support ---
UniConvertor doesn't have proper font support yet and should be used against
path-based files only. SVG (and possibly other files as well) can be converted
to path-based files in inkscape.

Adding .sfd files and appropriate font-files to ~/.uniconvertor will let
uniconvertor load those fonts; but most tests have revealed that correct usage
of the fonts are not to be expected.

See http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=504223 for a lengthy discussion of this.
