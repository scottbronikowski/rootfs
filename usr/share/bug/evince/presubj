= Reporting bugs for evince

The evince software doesnâ€™t do any rendering itself, but instead relies 
on software libraries that do the job. Unfortunately, due to lack of 
manpower, bugs in these libraries cannot be dealt with in Debian.

Therefore, if you encounter a bug in a PDF rendering, please report it 
upstream: https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=poppler

The same holds for PostScript rendering:
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=libspectre

If you want to report a bug in Evince itself, not related to a specific 
document, please go ahead.
