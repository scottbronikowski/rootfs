    <p>This assumes the reader knows how to explore and find documents.
    By the end of this page, the reader will be able to make collections.
    This topic is about:
    - Overview of how collections work.
    - How are collections searched? How can you only search inside a collection?
    - Can you put collections inside collections?
    </p>

  <p><app>Documents</app> lets you put together different documents of different
  types, in only one place called <gui>Collection</gui>.
  If you have documents that are related, you may group them to find documents
  easier. For example, if you have a business trip and you did a presentation
  there, you can group documents like your flight itinerary (which is a PDF file),
  your spreadsheet of the budget and and other hybrid PDF/ODF documents, in one
  collection.
  </p>

  <p>You may think that you can put collections inside collections, but
  the behavior of collections are not the same of the behavior of folders and
  their hierarchy. So,<em> you cannot put collections inside collections. </em>
  </p>

  <p>You can search collections
  by:</p>
  <list>
   <item><p>Pressing <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>F</key></keyseq> or
    <keyseq><key>Ctrl</key><key>S</key></keyseq>.</p></item>
   <item><p>Typing the name of the collection.</p></item>
   <item><p>Clicking on the magnifying glass icon, and select the filters related
   to the collection you are looking for. You can add a word to be more specific
   in the searching.</p></item>
  </list>
