<title>Manually set network settings</title>

<p>If your network doesn't automatically assign network settings to your computer, you may have to manually enter the settings yourself. This topic assumes that you already know the correct settings to use. If not, you may need to ask your network administrator or look at the settings of your router or network switch.</p>

<steps>
  <title>To manually set your network settings:</title>
 <item>
  <p>Click the network icon on the top bar and select <gui>Network Settings</gui>.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>Select the network connection that you want to set up manually and click <gui>Configure</gui>. For example, if you plug in to the network with a cable, look at <gui>Wired</gui>.</p>
  <p>Make sure that your wireless card is turned on or a network cable is plugged in. Otherwise, you won't be able to click <gui>Configure</gui>.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>Go to the <gui>IPv4 Settings</gui> tab and change the <gui>Method</gui> to <gui>Manual</gui>.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>Click <gui>Add</gui> and type the <em>IP address</em>, <em>network mask</em> and <em>default gateway IP address</em> into the corresponding columns of the <gui>Addresses</gui> list. Press <key>Enter</key> or <key>Tab</key> after typing each address.</p>
  <p>These three addresses must be IP addresses; that is, they must be four numbers separated by periods (e.g. 123.45.6.78).</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>Type the IP addresses of the DNS servers you want to use in the corresponding field, separated by commas.</p>
 </item>

 <item>
  <p>Click <gui>Save</gui>. If you are not connected to the network, click the network icon on the top bar and connect. Test the network settings by trying to visit a website or look at shared files on the network, for example.</p>
 </item>
