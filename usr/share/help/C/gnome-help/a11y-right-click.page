<title>Simulate a right mouse click</title>

<p>You can right-click by holding down the left mouse button. This is useful if
you find it difficult to move your fingers individually on one hand, or if your
pointing device only has a single button.</p>

<steps>
  <item><p>Click your name on the top bar and select
   <gui>System Settings</gui>.</p></item>
  <item><p>Open <gui>Universal Access</gui> and select the <gui>Pointing and
   Clicking</gui> tab.</p></item>
  <item><p>Switch <gui>Simulated Secondary Click</gui> on.</p></item>
</steps>

<p>You can change how long you must hold down the left mouse button before
it is registered as a right click. On the <gui>Pointing and Clicking</gui> tab,
change the <gui>Acceptance delay</gui> under
<gui>Simulated Secondary Click</gui>.</p>

<p>To right-click with simulated secondary click, hold down the left mouse
button where you would normally right-click, then release. The pointer fills
with blue as you hold down the left mouse button. Once it is entirely blue,
release the mouse button to right-click.</p>

<p>Some special pointers, such as the resize pointers, do not change colors.
You can still use simulated secondary click as normal, even if you don't get
visual feedback from the pointer.</p>

<p>If you use <link xref="mouse-mousekeys">Mouse Keys</link>, this also allows
you to right-click by holding down the <key>5</key> key on your keypad.</p>

<note>
<p>In the <gui>Activities</gui> overview, you are always able to long-press
to right-click, even with this feature disabled. Long-press works slightly
differently in the overview: You do not have to release the button to
right-click.</p>
