    <p>This topic is going to explain why there aren't thumbnails for documents
    stored remotely</p>
  </comment>

  <p>Every time you open <app>Documents</app> you can see a preview thumbnail
  in most of the documents.</p>
  <p>The documents that presented the preview thumbnail, are stored locally.</p>
  <p>You can not be able to see the preview thumbnail of others (or they are
  presented in blank) because they are stored in a remote server like
  <gui>Google Docs</gui>.</p>
  <p>If you want to see the preview thumbnail of the documents that are stored
  in remote servers, you may download them and then it will generate a thumbnail
  because they are going to be stored locally in your computer.</p>
  <note style="important">
  <p>The content of the document from <gui>Google Docs</gui> is going to be
  updated at the time you downloaded the document.</p><p>If you want to read an
  edit it online as you were doing before, it is better to not download.</p>
