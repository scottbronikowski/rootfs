Gtk2::Gdk::Color - wrapper for GdkColor

=cut

=for position DESCRIPTION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Gdk's colors are 16-bit RGB values -- that is, the red, green, and blue
components are integer values from 0 to 65535, with 65535 meaning full
saturation.  If you are used to dealing with colors on the range of 0 to
255, just scale those numbers by a factor of 257 (yes, 257!).
