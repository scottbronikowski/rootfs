=head1 NAME

Gtk2::Gdk::Colormap - wrapper for GdkColormap

=cut

=for position DESCRIPTION

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Colormaps are used to store the mappings between the RGB values you ask for
and the actual, hardware-dependent values used to display those colors.
The C<< $colormap->alloc_color >> and C<< $colormap->alloc_colors >> methods
do the necessary work to allocate a color within the visual; this actually
has nothing to do with memory management, so it is important that you call
C<< $colormap->free_colors >> to release those spots in the colormap
allocated by C<alloc_color> and C<alloc_colors>.
