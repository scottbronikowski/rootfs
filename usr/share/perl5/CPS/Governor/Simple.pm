=head1 NAME

C<CPS::Governor::Simple> - iterate immediately as fast as possible

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use CPS qw( gkforeach );
 use CPS::Governor::Simple;

 my $gov = CPS::Governor::Simple->new;

 gkforeach( $gov, [ 1 .. 10 ],
    sub { 
       my ( $item, $knext ) = @_;

       print "$item\n";
       goto &$knext;
    },
    sub {},
 );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This L<CPS::Governor> allows the functions using it to run as fast as
possible. It invokes its continuations immediately using a tailcall, so as not
to let the stack grow arbitrarily.

Its constructor takes no special arguments, and it provides no other methods
beyond those of C<CPS::Governor>.
