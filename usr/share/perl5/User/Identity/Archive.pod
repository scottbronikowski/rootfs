=head2 Access to the archive

$obj-E<gt>B<from>(SOURCE, OPTIONS)

=over 4

Read definitions from the specified SOURCE, which usually can be a
filehandle or filename.  The syntax used in the information SOURCE
is archiver dependent.

Not all archivers implement C<from()>, so you may want to check with
C<UNIVERSAL::can()> beforehand.

example: 

 use User::Identity::Archive::Some;
 my $a = User::Identity::Archive::Some->new('xyz');
 $a->from(\*STDIN) if $a->can('from');

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

Error: $object is not a collection.

=over 4

The first argument is an object, but not of a class which extends
L<User::Identity::Collection|User::Identity::Collection>.

=back

Error: Cannot load collection module for $type ($class).

=over 4

Either the specified $type does not exist, or that module named $class returns
compilation errors.  If the type as specified in the warning is not
the name of a package, you specified a nickname which was not defined.
Maybe you forgot the 'require' the package which defines the nickname.

=back

Error: Creation of a collection via $class failed.

=over 4

The $class did compile, but it was not possible to create an object
of that class using the options you specified.

=back

Error: Don't know what type of collection you want to add.

=over 4

If you add a collection, it must either by a collection object or a
list of options which can be used to create a collection object.  In
the latter case, the type of collection must be specified.

=back

Warning: No collection $name

=over 4

The collection with $name does not exist and can not be created.
