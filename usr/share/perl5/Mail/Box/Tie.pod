=head1 NAME

Mail::Box::Tie - access an existing message-folder as an array or hash

=head1 SYNOPSIS

As an array:

 use Mail::Box::Tie;
 tie my(@inbox), Mail::Box::Tie::ARRAY => $folder;
 tie my(@inbox), Mail::Box::Tie => $folder;    # deprecated
 print $inbox[3];

or as hash:

 tie my(%inbox), Mail::Box::Tie::HASH => $folder;
 tie my(%inbox), Mail::Box::Tie => $folder;    # deprecated
 print $inbox{'<12379.124879@example.com>'};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The use of C<Mail::Box::Tie> is B<deprecated>, because it is succeeded by two
separate modules: L<Mail::Box::Tie::ARRAY|Mail::Box::Tie::ARRAY> and L<Mail::Box::Tie::HASH|Mail::Box::Tie::HASH>.
However, this module still works.

Folders certainly look like an array of messages, so why not just
access them as one?  Or, the order is not important, but the
message-ids are (give relations): why not access them from a hash
based on this message-id?  Programs using one of these ties will
look simpler than programs using the more traditional method calls.
