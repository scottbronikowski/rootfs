- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Creates a temporary file of mode 0600 in the temporary directory, opens it with mode &quot;w+&quot;, and returns a Tempfile object which represents the created temporary file. A Tempfile object can be treated just like a normal File object.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The basename parameter is used to determine the name of a temporary file. If an Array is given, the first element is used as prefix string and the second as suffix string, respectively. Otherwise it is treated as prefix string.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If tmpdir is omitted, the temporary directory is determined by Dir::tmpdir provided by 'tmpdir.rb'. When $SAFE &gt; 0 and the given tmpdir is tainted, it uses /tmp. (Note that ENV values are tainted by default)
