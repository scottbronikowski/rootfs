  body: The above URI indicates that the client should connect to ftp.example.com then cd pub/ruby from the initial login directory.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "If you want to cd to an absolute directory, you must include an escaped / (%2F) in the path. Example:"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "    ftp://ftp.example.com/%2Fpub/ruby\n"
