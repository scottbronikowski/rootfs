Description: lxml is a Pythonic, mature binding for the libxml2 and libxslt libraries.  It
        provides safe and convenient access to these libraries using the ElementTree
        API.
        
        It extends the ElementTree API significantly to offer support for XPath,
        RelaxNG, XML Schema, XSLT, C14N and much more.
        
        To contact the project, go to the `project home page
        <http://lxml.de/>`_ or see our bug tracker at
        https://launchpad.net/lxml
        
        In case you want to use the current in-development version of lxml,
        you can get it from the github repository at
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml .  Note that this requires Cython to
        build the sources, see the build instructions on the project home
        page.  To the same end, running ``easy_install lxml==dev`` will
        install lxml from
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/master#egg=lxml-dev if you have
        an appropriate version of Cython installed.
        
        
        After an official release of a new stable series, bug fixes may become
        available at
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tree/lxml-2.3 .
        Running ``easy_install lxml==2.3bugfix`` will install
        the unreleased branch state from
        https://github.com/lxml/lxml/tarball/lxml-2.3#egg=lxml-2.3bugfix
        as soon as a maintenance branch has been established.  Note that this
        requires Cython to be installed at an appropriate version for the build.
        
        2.3.2 (2011-11-11)
        ==================
        
        Features added
        --------------
        
        * ``lxml.objectify.deannotate()`` has a new boolean option
          ``cleanup_namespaces`` to remove the objectify namespace
          declarations (and generally clean up the namespace declarations)
          after removing the type annotations.
        
        * ``lxml.objectify`` gained its own ``SubElement()`` function as a
          copy of ``etree.SubElement`` to avoid an otherwise redundant import
          of ``lxml.etree`` on the user side.
        
        Bugs fixed
        ----------
        
        * Fixed the "descendant" bug in cssselect a second time (after a first
          fix in lxml 2.3.1).  The previous change resulted in a serious
          performance regression for the XPath based evaluation of the
          translated expression.  Note that this breaks the usage of some of
          the generated XPath expressions as XSLT location paths that
          previously worked in 2.3.1.
        
        * Fixed parsing of some selectors in cssselect. Whitespace after combinators
          ">", "+" and "~" is now correctly ignored. Previously is was parsed as
          a descendant combinator. For example, "div> .foo" was parsed the same as
          "div>* .foo" instead of "div>.foo".
