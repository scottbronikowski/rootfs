% CAUTION: the first language will be the default if no style-file
%          (e.g. german.sty) is used.
% Since version 3.0 of TeX, hyphenation patterns for multiple languages are
% possible. Unless you know what you are doing, please let the american
% english patterns be the first ones. The babel system allows you to
% easily change the active language for your texts. For more information,
% have a look to the documentation in texmf/doc/generic/babel.
