Author: HDF Group - NCSA Scientific Data Technologies
Abstract: The Hierarchical Data Format, or HDF, is a multiobject file format 
 for sharing scientific data in a distributed environment. HDF was
 created at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications to
 serve the needs of diverse groups of scientists working on projects in
 various fields. HDF was designed to address many requirements for
 storing scientific data, including:
 .
 - Support for the types of data and metadata commonly used by scientists. 
 - Efficient storage of and access to large data sets. 
 - Platform independence. 
 - Extensibility for future enhancements and compatibility with other
    standard formats.
