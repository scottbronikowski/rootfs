Title: PSGML: A Emacs major mode for SGML.
Author: Lennart Staflin
Abstract: SGML is a major mode for editing SGML documents.  
 It contains a simple SGML parser and can work with any DTD. 
 (The most popular nowadays are the HTML DTD's. PSGML can turn your 
 emacs into the one of most powerful HTML editors and will be 
 ultimately flexible as well, since you could upgrade your editor by 
 just installing new DTD's). Functions provided includes menus and 
 commands for inserting tags with only the contextually valid tags, 
 identification of structural errors, editing of attribute values in 
 a separate window with information about types and defaults, and 
 structure based editing. 
 SGML, a language for encoding the structure of a document, is an ISO 
 standard: ISO 8879:1986 'Information processing - Text and office 
 systems - Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML)'.
