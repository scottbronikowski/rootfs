-- Discovered that 1. Raw PGR images are 1/4 the size of BGRU-converted PGR (and Imlib) images, 2. Raw PGR images can be converted to BGR (vice BGRU) for a 25% reduction in size);
-- Looking into sending raw PGR images across network, but first need to have flycapture libraries installed on seykhl in order to reconstruct the PGR image and convert it to color (specifically need PGR Image class, along with PixelFormat and BayerTileFormat data types);
-- Got 4g dongle working--comes up as eth0 automatically, then must call 'dhclient eth0' to get local IP, should be set to connect to internet automatically now, but if not, use 'wget -T 30 http://192.168.32.2/condata?action=connect';
-- Generic USB Wifi dongle "sort-of" working--causes crashes after sustained data transfer.  Need to look at how it's set up.  Added lines for wlan2 in /etc/network/interfaces;
-- try UDP sockets instead of TCP for less overhead??
