worked on simpletest.c and newtest.c; used ~/test_code/flycapture/src/CustomImageEx/CustomImageEx.cpp as a starting point for a multiple cam setup that can capture in color; best speed is ~24fps if both cameras running at 640x480; getting around 8.7-9.5fps with front camera at 640x480 and pano camera at 1240x934 (dialed in for fisheye lens); front cam resolutions: 1000x750 = ~5fps; 960x720 = ~6.3fps
