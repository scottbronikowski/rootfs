Patches to allow PWM control from a Beagleboard.

The default OpenEmbedded HEAD builds kernels for the beagleboard with the 
CONFIG_OMAP_RESET_CLOCKS option enabled. This is a power saving feature, 
but will not allow us to control the timers for PWM. The patches here disable
this. 

The current OE HEAD has a virtual/kernel of linux-omap-psp-2.6.32 for the 
Beagleboard.

These patches are here as a convenience only for a short time.

Apply the recipe patch, manually or automatically. It's only a one line change.

Copy the 0100-omap-reset-clocks-disabled.patch to 
${OETREE}/openembedded/recipes/linux/linux-omap-psp-2.6.32
where the other patches are.

Then rebuild the kernel and your rootfs and deploy those.
bitbake -c clean virtual/kernel; bitbake virtual/kernel; bitbake <your-image>

Then rebuild pwm.ko since the kernel config has changed.
