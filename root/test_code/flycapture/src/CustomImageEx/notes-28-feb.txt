worked on simpletest.c and newtest.c; used ~/test_code/flycapture/src/CustomImageEx/CustomImageEx.cpp as a starting point for a multiple cam setup that can capture in color; best speed is ~24fps if both cameras running at 640x480; dialed in pano cam for fisheye lens with 1240x934 with offset of (34,14); with pano set, front cam resolutions/speed are: 1000x750/~5fps, 960x720/6.3fps, 880x660/7.1fps ,800x600/7.8fps, 720x540/8.3fps ,640x480/8.8fps; going with 800x600 as a reasonable medium; set X and Y offset for front based on (maxW - imageW)/2; should be ready to start integrating CustomImageEx code with code to send images over network; also, check on setting wthie balance
