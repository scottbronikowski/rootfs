To get Scheme->C to work under ILisp I had to create my own executable with
the following C foreign function:

#include <stdio.h>
void nobuff(){setbuf(stdout, (char*)0);}

(define-c-external (nobuff) void "nobuff")
(nobuff)

I had to do a similar thing to get SCM to work in an Epsilon process buffer
under DOS.

This may or may not have to do with your problem.
