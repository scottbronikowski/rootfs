including Lucid, Allegro, Harlequin LispWorks, KCL, AKCL, ECL, IBCL,
and CMUCL.

Future developments:

ILISP might become part of the standard FSF distribution in the
future. There are numerous little things that need to be done in that
direction in order to conform to FSF coding and interface standards
(e.g. the behavior of C-a is not acceptable by the FSF interface
standard and numerous doc strings in ILISP need to be rewritten).
This will happen slowly over the next(s) releases.
