Welcome to the ILISP Discussion mailing list.

ILISP is a GNU Emacs package for controlling an inferior process
running a lisp dialect.  You can get ILISP by anonymous ftp at
FTP.CS.CMU.EDU in the directory /user/ai/lang/lisp/util/emacs/ilisp/.

Alternative archive sites (which may be out of date) include:
 h.gp.cs.cmu.edu:/usr/rfb/ilisp
 haldane.bu.edu:/pub/ilisp

ILISP is currently being maintained by Marco Antoniotti
<marcoxa@cs.nyu.edu> and Rick Busdiecker <rfb@lehman.com>.

Please address all list administration messages, such as requests to
subscribe or unsubscribe, to:

 ILISP Administrivia <ilisp-request@lehman.com>

and we will both see your message.  Please allow a little time;
there's no list server programming running, the list is maintained by
hand.

To send a message to everyone on the list, address it to:

 ILISP Discussion <ilisp@lehman.com>

The list has had a very low volume lately, so you may not see messages
for a while after subscribing.

Please note that there is no list corresponding to the old
ilisp-bugs@darwin.bu.edu address.  Send message which would have gone
there to the primary list.  I will try to forward any messages that
arrive via that address to the list, but I (usually :-) have better
things to do with my time.
