;;; Commentary:

;; Due to the fact that MPlayer recommends use of non-free
;; software (and in part due to the poor quality of its
;; backend interface), we have chosen to remove MPlayer
;; support from the main Bongo repository.

;; We recommend VLC as a replacement player.  If you still
;; want to use MPlayer, this package lets you do it.

;;; Code:

(require 'bongo)

(define-bongo-backend mplayer
  :constructor 'bongo-start-mplayer-player

  ;; We define this variable manually so that we can get
  ;; some other customization variables to appear before it.

  ;; matches that of some potentially supported format.
